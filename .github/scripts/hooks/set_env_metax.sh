# Resolve the operator names the checked-in Python kernels call against the
# FlagGems an interpreter in $1 imports, and print "<missing>/<total>".
#
# A generated kernel calls its operator by package-level name
# (`flag_gems.<name>`), resolved at dispatch time by
# csrc/aten/backends/flagos/python_op_caller.cc:GetFunc -- by getattr on the
# package. A cohort that does not define one of those names therefore raises
# AttributeError on the routes that use it, which is why "a FlagGems is
# installed" is not the property worth checking. Must run from the repo root:
# that is where the generated kernels are.
#
# $2, when "torch_fl", imports torch_fl in the probe process before flag_gems.
# Only the venv call passes it; see the cohort check at the end of this script
# for why the ordering is load-bearing on MetaX. The vendor interpreter must not
# get it: it has its own MetaX torch, and this checkout's build-tree torch_fl is
# not built for that interpreter.

# carries beside its own MetaX torch install. FlagGems is required because

# --- FlagGems cohort ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# Confirm the vendor packages actually import against the CPU torch wheel, and

# Failing here names the gap once instead of as a dispatch error per op.
#
# This runs after the native build, and not with the FlagGems install above,
# because on MetaX flag_gems cannot be imported by a process that has not
# imported torch_fl first -- set_env_musa.sh documents the same ordering for
# MThreads, for a different reason. Both halves are load-bearing:
#
#   * the venv's torch is the stock +cpu wheel, and a stock +cpu torch/lib has no
#     libtorch_cuda.so at all, so torch.cuda.is_available() is False there. The
#     MetaX FlagTree Triton then resolves zero active drivers.
#   * flag_gems reaches that resolution during its own import:
#     flag_gems/__init__.py -> flag_gems.fused -> fused/beam_search_score.py ->
#     utils/pointwise_dynamic.py (scalar_fn.cache_key) -> triton.runtime.jit
#     .parse -> triton/compiler/hint_manager.py:hint_get_flagtree_backend ->
#     hasattr(triton.runtime.driver, "active"). That attribute is a property
#     that builds the driver, and the hint manager catches only ImportError, so
#     the RuntimeError escapes the import:
#
#       RuntimeError: 0 active drivers ([]). There should only be one.
#         triton/spec/metax/triton/runtime/driver.py:14, in _create_driver
#
#     Seen in this job with flagtree 0.6.1+metax3.6 and torch 2.10.0+cpu in
#     /opt/venv, and reproduced on the C550 host by hiding the device
#     (CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" python -c "import flag_gems"). The shared input
#     is triton/backends/metax/driver.py:515 is_active() ->
#     torch.cuda.is_available(); it is False for a torch/lib with no
#     libtorch_cuda.so and for a device that is not visible alike.
#
#     Importing torch_fl is what removes that condition: it points the stock
#     wheel's torch/lib at the MetaX libtorch (the bundle
#     bundle_maca_libtorch.sh just wrote, or FLAGOS_VENDOR_TORCH_LIB), and it has
#     to happen before `import torch` -- which is exactly the order the probe
#     uses. The relink is on disk, so it holds for every later process, the
#     tests included.
#
# torch_fl._C is what makes torch_fl importable at all, and build_ext has just
# built it. The gate mirrors set_env_musa.sh's `import torch_fl._C` guard: on a
# tree without the extension there is nothing to probe, and that is not a
