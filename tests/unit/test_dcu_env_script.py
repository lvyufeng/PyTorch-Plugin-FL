"""Static guards for the DCU environment script that provisions FlagTree.

``set_env_dcu.sh`` runs before every DCU job can do anything, so a defect in it
is not a test failure -- it is a job that produces no results at all. That is
what happened when the FlagTree/FlagGems provisioning landed: the triton
cleanup used ``while pip uninstall ...; do :; done``, and ``pip uninstall -y``
exits 0 even when it skips every named package, so the loop never terminated.
The job sat on that line with all output sent to ``/dev/null`` until the
60-minute job timeout cancelled it.

These checks are static on purpose: they must run on any host, without a DCU or
a network.
