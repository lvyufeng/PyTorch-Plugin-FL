// True when the conf names `op_name` at all, i.e. whether the value above is
// the file's routing decision or the unlisted default. Most callers do not need
// this: for a generated leaf kernel the two are equivalent, because the
// default and the absence of an override lead to the same kernel. It matters
// for an op whose FlagGems support is per-platform and opt-in by measurement --
// a conf that predates that route, or a third party's, has not asked for it, so
// "unlisted" has to keep the pre-existing path instead of silently acquiring a
// new one. A caller that reads false must therefore do what the op did before
// the FlagGems route existed, not pick a default of its own; see
// csrc/aten/sdp_choice_stub.cc.
bool HasBackendForOp(const std::string& op_name);

// Record the conf path Python resolved at import time. Must be called before
// the first op dispatch, which is when the table is built. It is not written to
// os.environ: the wheel's own selection has to stay distinguishable from a
// user's FLAGOS_BACKEND_CONFIG, and an environment write makes them identical
// for the rest of the process.
//
// FLAGOS_EXPORT because of who calls it: the binding is
// torch_fl._C._set_backend_config_path, and torch_fl/csrc/module.cc is linked
// into libtorch_bindings.so, not into libtorch_fl.so. CMakeLists.txt sets
// CMAKE_CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden, so an unannotated definition here is
// local to libtorch_fl.so and the import fails with an undefined symbol rather
// than a link error -- shared-library linking leaves undefined symbols alone.
FLAGOS_EXPORT void SetBackendConfigPath(const std::string& path);

// The value of FLAGOS_FORCE_BACKEND -- "flaggems", "vendor" or "tileops" -- or an
// empty string when it is unset (or was unparseable, which warns and reads as
// unset). Resolved once per process, so Dispatcher can consult it on the
// dispatch-miss path without re-reading the environment per op.
const std::string& ForcedBackendMode();

// True when FLAGOS_LOG -- a comma-separated list -- names `item`, one of
// "dispatch", "fallback" or "op_cache". Three separate booleans used to gate
// these, and none could be discovered by reading the environment: you had to
// know the name first. One list puts the whole menu in one place, in the
// variable's own value.
//
// An item that names nothing is reported once per process, because a typo would
// otherwise turn a diagnostic off silently -- which is exactly what those
// booleans did not do.
bool LogEnabled(const char* item);

// Dtypes this build's FlagGems (Triton) route cannot serve, whatever op is
// asking. Consulted by Dispatcher so a `flaggems` route falls back to the
// vendor kernel for those dtypes instead of failing inside the compiler.
//
// A vendor conf is a per-op routing table, so it cannot express "FlagGems,
// except for dtype X" -- and on Ascend that exception is real and broad.
// BiShengHIR rejects the float64 instantiation of nearly every kernel
// FlagGems' pointwise codegen produces: on Ascend910 with CANN 9.0.0 and
// FlagTree 0.6.2a1+ascend3.5, add/sub/div/neg/abs/exp/log/sqrt/reciprocal/
// where/clamp/fill_/zeros_like/ones_like/ones/full/arange over float64
// all raise MLIRCompilationError from triton's spec/ascend compiler
// ("'hivm.hir.vbrc' op failed to verify that operand at idx 0 should have
// element type ...", or "ub overflow" on the larger shapes), while mul, cat
// and the comparison ops -- which lower through a different path -- do work.
// The same calls reach aclnn kernels through the vendor slot and return the
// right float64 answer, so the fallback is a gain rather than a loss.
//
// On GCU the same shape of gap exists for int64, and it fails in two
// different places on the way to the same non-existent kernel. A kernel whose
// operand is i64 makes flag_gems' pointwise codegen request a pass option the
// installed toolkit does not declare -- flag_gems 5.3.2 and the enflame 3.6
// triton backend append `enable_i64=true` to `--convert-gpu-to-gcu`
// (runtime/backend/_enflame/gcu300/utils/pointwise_dynamic.py, and
// triton/backends/enflame/compiler.py), while
// /opt/triton_gcu/bin/gcu-compiler-opt (2026-05-21, LLVM 21.0.0git) exposes
// only `--chipset` and `--vector-bit-width` for that pass:
//
//   Exception: <unknown>:0: error: <Pass-Options-Parser>: no such option
//   enable_i64
//
// raised from triton/backends/enflame/toolkit.py's `_run_command`. A kernel
// that gets past that raises the compiler's own verdict instead,
//
//   RuntimeError: Pipeline run failed: PassManager execution failed
//
// from `error: 64-bit data type not supported on GCU300!`. Measured on the
// shipped `backends_gcu.conf` (torch 2.10.0+cpu, S60, card 2): `clamp`,
// `clamp_min`, `clamp_max`, `clamp_`, `fmod.Tensor` and `rsub.Scalar` over
// int64 hit one or the other, and `remainder.Tensor` over int64 is worse
// than either -- it returns a plausible int32 tensor, so nothing upstream
// can tell it went wrong.
//
// The blast radius was measured rather than assumed, because the escape
// cannot help an op the platform has no vendor kernel for: `ResolveFn` is
// only consulted on the FlagGems route and returns that route unchanged when
// the op's vendor slot is empty, so a route can only move for an op the conf
// left on FlagGems *and* the GCU codegen registered a kernel for. That
// intersection is exactly seven ops on the shipped conf -- clamp,
// fmod.Tensor, gelu, mean, mean.dim, remainder.Tensor, silu -- and the vendor
// kernels that take them over are int64-safe by construction: every generated
// GCU kernel that calls topsaten is gated on TopsatenSupportsDtype, which
// excludes int64, so int64 there is the template's CPU round-trip.
//
// float64 is deliberately absent. It fails with the same two signatures
// (measured on the same conf: clamp/clamp_min/clamp_max/fmod.Tensor/
// rsub.Scalar/gelu/silu/mean over float64 all raise), but one FlagGems f64
// route inside that same seven -- remainder.Tensor -- is correct today, so a
// 64-bit-wide rule would trade a working FlagGems kernel for the vendor
// template's CPU round-trip in order to fix nothing, and no cohort here
// measures f64. That half wants its own decision with its own evidence.
//
// Ascend and GCU are separate `#if` branches because neither is a subset of
// the other: Ascend serves int64 on FlagGems and rejects float64, GCU serves
// float64 there and rejects int64.
//
// Deliberately a predicate on the dtype alone and not on (op, dtype): every op
// that reaches this build's FlagGems route with one of the dtypes above is
// affected, so naming the op would carry no information. A gap that is
// specific to one op cannot be expressed here and does not belong here --
// see FlagGemsRejectsOpDtype below.
bool FlagGemsRejectsDtype(at::ScalarType dtype);

// The (op, dtype) form of the same escape, for the gaps where neither half
// decides on its own: a FlagGems kernel that is unguarded about the element
// type it code-generates, called with a dtype the reference implementation of
// that op rejects outright. `neg` over bool is the entry in the table today.
//
// Both of the other mechanisms were measured against this gap and neither can
// state it. A conf entry routes a whole op: `neg` over
// fp16/bf16/fp32/fp64/int8/int16/int32/int64/uint8 is correct on the FlagGems
// route, so a NATIVE_TRITON_GAPS entry would move all of them off it and onto
// the Ascend template's CPU round-trip -- which IsUnaryDtypeSupported sends
// every integral through, costing 7-30x on integral `neg` to gain 10x on
// fp32. The dtype-wide predicate above cannot state it either: bool is not a
// dtype FlagGems fails for in general (add/sub/abs/... all take a bool operand
// on this build), so a dtype-wide rule would take those down with it.
//
// `op_name` is the routed name -- the conf key, so it carries a ".out" suffix
// only for the calls dispatched under one -- not the ATen schema name.
