# MetaX Installation Guide

## Overview

MetaX ships a **self-contained boxing wheel**: it reuses PyTorch's CUDA boxing kernels (compiled with host `g++`, no `mxcc`) and bundles the MetaX-forked libtorch C++ runtime inside the wheel. The target machine needs only the stock `torch==2.10.0+cpu` wheel, this `torch_fl` wheel, and the `/opt/maca` driver runtime.

**Status:** Stable. CI validates representative operator dispatch and factory/autograd tests on 8-GPU MetaX runners. FlagGems and model-level validation are not covered in CI.

## Prerequisites

### Build Host (Wheel Builder)

Requires the full MetaX SDK and a `torch+metax` wheel to extract the forked libtorch:

- MetaX MACA SDK (driver + cu-bridge), installed to `/opt/maca` or `$MACA_PATH`
- `torch+metax` wheel (`maca-pytorch`) from the MetaX developer portal (SoftNova)
- Python 3.8 or later matching the target deployment environment
- `patchelf` (`pip install patchelf`)

**Getting the MetaX SDK and torch+metax wheel:**  
Both are distributed through the MetaX developer portal: <https://developer.metax-tech.com/softnova>. Registration and login are required. Download the MACA SDK matching your card and driver version, and the `torch+metax` wheel built for the same MACA version and your Python version. Install the SDK to `/opt/maca` (or export `MACA_PATH` to the install location).

### Target Host (Deployment)

Requires only:

- Official `torch==2.10.0+cpu` from PyPI (no CUDA)
- The `torch_fl` wheel built below
- `/opt/maca` driver runtime (present on any machine with a MetaX card)

No separate `torch+metax` wheel, no manual `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` configuration.

## Installation

### Building the Wheel

#### Step 1: Build the Boxing Artifacts

On a machine with the MetaX SDK and `torch+metax` wheel available:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flagos-ai/PyTorch-Plugin-FL.git
cd PyTorch-Plugin-FL

# Build the boxing artifacts (no native kernels)
FLAGOS_ACCELERATOR=metax \
  FLAGOS_BUILD_VENDOR=OFF \
  FLAGOS_VENDOR_TORCH_LIB=<path-to-torch+metax>/torch/lib \
  FLAGOS_WHEEL_LOCAL=metax3.8.1 \
  python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

**Parameters:**
- `FLAGOS_VENDOR_TORCH_LIB`: Path to the `torch+metax` wheel's `torch/lib` directory (source of forked libtorch)
- `FLAGOS_WHEEL_LOCAL`: Local version tag (e.g., `metax3.8.1` → wheel version `0.1.0+metax3.8.1`), identifying the target MACA/driver version

#### Step 2: Bundle the Forked Libtorch

```bash
FLAGOS_VENDOR_TORCH_LIB=<path-to-torch+metax>/torch/lib \
  MACA_PATH=/opt/maca \
  bash scripts/vendor/bundle_maca_libtorch.sh
```

This script:
- Copies 8 forked libtorch `.so` files from `torch+metax/torch/lib` into `torch_fl/lib_maca/`
- Rewrites RPATH with `patchelf` so libraries find each other via `$ORIGIN` and locate the MACA runtime at `/opt/maca/lib`

#### Step 3: Repackage the Wheel

```bash
python setup.py build_py
cp build/lib.*/torch_fl/_C.*.so build/lib.*/torch_fl/
python setup.py bdist_wheel --skip-build --bdist-dir "$(mktemp -d)"
```

The result is `dist/torch_fl-0.1.0+metax3.8.1-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl` (~1.1 GB — it bundles the forked libtorch and exceeds PyPI's 100 MB limit; distribute via private index or direct transfer).

### Installation on Target Host

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install torch==2.10.0+cpu --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install torch_fl-0.1.0+metax3.8.1-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl
```

#### Runtime Configuration

No environment variable is needed: a MetaX wheel records that it was built for
MetaX, and `import torch_fl` selects `backends_metax.conf` from that record. The
import-order rule below is what matters.

**Import order:** On MetaX, you **must** import `torch_fl` before `import torch`:

```python
import torch_fl  # Must import first
import torch
```

**Reason:** PyTorch's bundled CUDA 12.x runtime is ABI-incompatible with MetaX's cu-bridge (CUDA 11.6 compatibility layer). `torch_fl` preloads a shim library to provide the required symbol versions before torch initializes.

## Verification

### Basic Device Check

```bash
python -c "
import torch_fl  # Import first
import torch

print(f'PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}')
print(f'torch.cuda devices (MetaX): {torch.cuda.device_count()}')
print(f'flagos devices: {torch.flagos.device_count()}')
print(f'flagos available: {torch.flagos.is_available()}')

# Basic computation
x = torch.randn(4, 4, device='flagos:0')
y = (x + x).sum()
print(f'Sample result: {y.cpu().item():.4f}')
"
```

Expected output shows `torch.cuda devices: N` and `flagos devices: N` (MetaX cards present as `torch.cuda` devices), and a floating-point result.

### Operator Validation

Run representative operator tests:

```bash
pytest \
  tests/integration/ops/test_abs_dispatch.py \
  tests/integration/ops/test_add_dispatch.py \
  tests/integration/ops/test_bmm_dispatch.py \
  tests/integration/ops/test_mm_dispatch.py \
  tests/integration/ops/test_softmax_dispatch.py \
  -m "not flaggems and not flaggems_python and not flaggems_cpp" \
  -v --tb=short
```

### Factory and Autograd

```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_factory_ops.py -v --tb=short
```

### Automatic Mixed Precision

MetaX boxing reuses the CUDA operator path while exposing PyTorch's device-generic
AMP API through `flagos`. Both FP16 and BF16 are supported autocast targets, and
`GradScaler` uses the boxed CUDA non-finite check and unscale kernels:

```python
import torch_fl  # Import first on MetaX.
import torch

model = torch.nn.Linear(8, 4).to("flagos")
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
scaler = torch.amp.GradScaler("flagos")
x = torch.randn(2, 8, device="flagos")
target = torch.randn(2, 4, device="flagos")

with torch.autocast("flagos", dtype=torch.float16):
    output = model(x)
    loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(output, target)

scaler.scale(loss).backward()
scaler.step(optimizer)
scaler.update()
```

Run the complete autocast and GradScaler contract on MetaX hardware:

```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_amp_contract.py -m amp -v --tb=short
```

The measured C550/MACA 3.8.0 coverage includes FP16 and BF16 lower-precision,
FP32, optional-dtype, and promote autocast policies; nested state; non-finite
unscale; finite scale growth; overflow backoff; and a forward/backward optimizer
step. This validation applies to the boxing path, not the legacy handwritten
MetaX kernel mode.

### Low-Precision Matrix Operations

MetaX boxing also provides software emulation for scalar FP8 and packed FP4 matrix
inputs. The supported dtypes are `float8_e4m3fn`, `float8_e5m2`,
`float8_e4m3fnuz`, `float8_e5m2fnuz`, `float8_e8m0fnu`, and
`float4_e2m1fn_x2`. The shared device-side path decodes inputs to BF16 and uses
ordinary device GEMM for `mm`, `bmm`, and `addmm`, including `dtype` and `out`
variants and in-place `addmm_`. Without an explicit output dtype, results are BF16;
an explicit output dtype is preserved.

This support does not include block-scaled metadata formats such as MXFP4, NVFP4,
or block FP4, and `_scaled_mm`/`_scaled_grouped_mm` remain fail-closed because no
software kernel is provided for their scale metadata contract. Validate the path on
a C550 target with:

```bash
pytest tests/integration/ops/test_soft_lowp_gate_dispatch.py -m soft_lowp -v -s --tb=short
```

On the C550/MACA 3.8.0 environment used for this checkout, the complete marked suite
passed (`37 passed`), including all five FP8 formats, packed FP4, `mm`/`bmm`/`addmm`,
`dtype`/`out` variants, non-square packed layouts, in-place `addmm_`, and the fail-closed
scaled-mm check. Re-run the command above after changing the build or vendor runtime;
the result applies to the CUDA-boxing path and not the legacy handwritten MetaX kernel mode.

### torch.compile and FlagTree

The boxing path supports `torch.compile(backend="flagos")` with either the MetaX
Triton distribution or a MetaX-enabled [FlagTree](https://github.com/flagos-ai/FlagTree)
build. FlagTree installs the module named `triton`; `FLAGOS_USE_FLAGTREE=1`
asserts that this replacement is active rather than switching it at runtime.

A Triton is required: the official `torch==2.10.0+cpu` wheel this path installs
against ships none, and Inductor raises `TritonMissing` without one. Install or
expose the MetaX Triton distribution (`triton-3.6.0+metax*`) alongside the CPU
wheel; linking just the `triton` package and its `.dist-info` is enough, and the
`.dist-info` is required because Triton discovers its hardware backends through
`importlib.metadata` entry points.

Inductor forwards the Triton backend name (`maca` on MetaX) to its benchmarker as
a torch device during autotuning. The vendor MetaX torch build patches that
in-tree; the official CPU wheel does not, so torch_fl maps `maca` back to `cuda`
itself (`torch_fl/compile/device_interface.py`). Both refer to the same physical
GPU, so no separate configuration is needed.
Build FlagTree main (Triton 3.6 for PyTorch 2.10) in a separate environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flagos-ai/FlagTree.git
cd FlagTree
export FLAGTREE_BACKEND=metax
MAX_JOBS=64 python -m pip install . --no-build-isolation -v
```

A released MetaX FlagTree wheel is available from the FlagOS index
(`flagtree==0.6.1+metax3.6`; see *FlagGems on MetaX* below) — building from source
is what the revision-pinned evidence above used, and the two install the same
`triton` module.

Then run the compile contract with that environment's site-packages ahead of the
normal MetaX Triton installation:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/flagtree-venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages \
  FLAGOS_USE_FLAGTREE=1 \
  pytest tests/integration/test_compile.py -v --tb=short
```

On C550 with MACA 3.8.0, the full suite passed with FlagTree revision
`140bd6ab1ad86c5df4b07b76d9c722e357a9166d` (Triton 3.6, MetaX backend),
covering forward, backward, FP32/FP16, max-autotune, recompilation, FakeTensor
tracing, and output/gradient residency on `flagos`. The installed MetaX Triton
path passed the same applicable tests; only the FlagTree-identity test is skipped
outside a FlagTree environment.

## FlagGems on MetaX

The MetaX boxing wheel compiles the FlagGems Python dispatch slot by default, and `backends_metax.conf` is FlagGems-first and is the only conf a MetaX boxing build ships. `import torch_fl` therefore routes 592 of the conf's 2037 ops to the FlagGems Python path and 12 to the FlagGems C++ path on its own; the rest fall back to the CUDA boxing kernel (`mm`/`bmm`/`mean.dim`/`sum.dim_IntList` and other ops `triton-metax` cannot compile — FlagGems uses a SPLIT_K kwarg or a CUDA-context path `triton-metax` rejects).

One of the 592 is not a leaf op: `scaled_dot_product_attention` is a composite, and its conf key is read by the private-use kernel itself rather than by the dispatcher, so the route is taken only for the shapes `FlagGemsEligible` in `csrc/aten/sdp_choice_stub.cc` admits — bf16, 4-D, head_dim 128, sequence length 1024 or more, and no mask, causal flag or `scale`. Every other shape falls through to the boxing kernel under the same conf key. Set `FLAGOS_OP_scaled_dot_product_attention=cuda` to take the boxing route everywhere.

There is no switch that turns this on: routing is a property of the build (`torch_fl/__init__.py:_select_backend_config`), not of an environment variable. The practical consequence is that FlagGems is a runtime **dependency** rather than an option — an op routed to a FlagGems backend whose callable is absent raises at dispatch instead of falling back to boxing.

Two target-side dependencies, neither of them on PyPI:

```bash
# On the target MetaX machine, in addition to torch+cpu and torch_fl:
# FlagTree's MetaX Triton build. It installs as the `triton` module and supplies
# the `metax` backend the generated kernels were measured against.
python3 -m pip uninstall -y triton  # repeat until fully uninstalled
pip install flagtree==0.6.1+metax3.6 \
  --index-url=https://resource.flagos.net/repository/flagos-pypi-hosted/simple

# FlagGems, at the revision the checked-in kernels were generated from.
pip install "git+https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagGems.git@5a58df410c551c4f4eb41d31887cd75fd596804a"
```

The FlagGems revision is load-bearing, not cosmetic. A generated kernel calls its operator by package-level name (`flag_gems.<name>`), resolved by `getattr` at dispatch time (`csrc/aten/backends/flagos/python_op_caller.cc:GetFunc`), so a cohort that does not define one of those names fails exactly the routes that use it. The revision above resolves all 666 names the checked-in `csrc/aten/generated/flaggems_python_kernels.cc` calls; `.github/scripts/set_env_metax.sh` measures that ratio before every integration job and refuses to run when it is not `0/666`.

That measurement has an import-order requirement of its own, because the setup venv runs the stock `torch+cpu` wheel: its `torch/lib` carries no `libtorch_cuda.so`, so `torch.cuda.is_available()` is `False` until `torch_fl` has relinked that directory to the MetaX libtorch. In that state the MetaX Triton backend reports itself inactive (`triton/backends/metax/driver.py:is_active`), and `flag_gems` reaches `triton.runtime.driver.active` while it is being imported (`flag_gems.fused` -> `pointwise_dynamic` -> `triton.runtime.jit.parse` -> the Triton hint manager's backend lookup), so a bare `import flag_gems` in the venv fails with `RuntimeError: 0 active drivers ([]). There should only be one.` — the FlagGems install is fine, the probe is simply running too early. The ratio is therefore taken in a process that imports `torch_fl` first, at the end of the setup script rather than beside the FlagGems install, since `torch_fl` is not importable until `setup.py build_ext` has run. The same rule applies to any ad-hoc check against the venv: `import torch_fl`
first, or the device surface is not there yet.

### Runtime Configuration

```bash
```

`FLAGOS_USE_FLAGGEMS` is not part of this: the retired switch selected a conf on no platform, and nothing reads it any more. Setting it does not change routing; `@pytest.mark.flaggems` cases run wherever they are collected.

### FlagGems Verification

```bash
FLAGOS_LOG=dispatch python -c "
import torch_fl, torch
x = torch.randn(1024, device='flagos:0')
result = torch.nn.functional.silu(x).sum()
print(f'FlagGems SILU result: {result.cpu().item():.4f}')
"
```

The dispatch log line the run prints for `silu` names the backend that served it (`[flagos dispatch] silu -> flagos_python`) — the conf's route, not an environment switch. `tests/integration/ops/backend_conf.py:routed_backend()` resolves that name from the conf so a test can assert it on any platform.

Without FlagTree or FlagGems installed, the 604 ops routed to a FlagGems backend raise at dispatch; there is no pure-boxing configuration of this wheel.

## Distributed (Experimental)

Multi-GPU distributed training routes through the NCCL-shaped `mccl` fallback. The routing exists architecturally (see `_VENDOR_PROFILES["metax"]` in `torch_fl/comm/process_group.py`), but collective-level validation is not covered in CI. Manual verification on MetaX hardware is required.

## Model Inference and Training (Manual)

MetaX carries FSDP2 and Qwen3 training parity work in repository history, but these tests are not part of the CI manifest. Model-level validation remains a manual exercise on MetaX hardware.

## fp32 Matmul Precision (TF32)

An fp32 `mm`/`bmm` on MetaX computes in fp32 by default. The MetaX container
image used by this project's CI does not: it exports

```bash
TORCH_ALLOW_TF32_CUBLAS_OVERRIDE=1
```

ATen reads that variable while it initialises its TF32 state, so it is applied
before any user code runs and before the device is touched:

```python
torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32      # True
torch.backends.cuda.matmul.fp32_precision  # 'tf32'
```

MACA's GEMM then takes its TF32 kernel for an fp32 product — profiling an fp32
`addmm` in that process names `mcblas__Mck_tf32gemm_tn_..._tf32_...` — which is
the documented meaning of the variable and is what PyTorch asked for. The vendor
kernel is faithful to that setting; `torch_fl` never changes it, and no routing
change recovers the bits, because the same setting is inherited by every other
vendor GEMM the process reaches (fp32 `scaled_dot_product_attention` on the
MetaX build is served from the vendor path and loses precision the same way).
This is a property of the deployment environment, not of the wheel.

The loss is ~900x, whatever the op and shape. Relative Frobenius error against an
fp64 CPU reference, 5 shapes × 20 seeds on a C550:

| computation | relative error |
| --- | --- |
| fp32 (`TORCH_ALLOW_TF32_CUBLAS_OVERRIDE=0`) | 6.0e-08 .. 2.9e-07 |
| TF32 (image default) | 2.6e-04 .. 3.3e-04 |

Check it in one line:

```bash
python -c "
import torch_fl, torch
torch.manual_seed(0)
a, b = torch.randn(64, 128), torch.randn(128, 32)
got = torch.mm(a.to('flagos:0'), b.to('flagos:0')).cpu().double()
ref = torch.mm(a.double(), b.double())
print('relative error:', ((got - ref).norm() / ref.norm()).item())
# ~3e-07 is fp32, ~3e-04 is TF32
"
```

### Turning it off

Set the variable to `0` (or leave it unset) **before the process starts** — `0` is
the explicit-off spelling, and it is what cancels an inherited `1`. Unset and `0`
are numerically identical; a non-numeric value such as `false` or an empty string
raises a `UserWarning` and is treated as off.

```bash
TORCH_ALLOW_TF32_CUBLAS_OVERRIDE=0 python your_script.py
```

For a process that cannot change its environment, the setting is reachable
in-process, and the legacy accessor is the one to use:

```python
torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = False   # clean: no warning, both accessors stay readable
```

`torch.backends.cuda.matmul.fp32_precision = "ieee"` also takes effect, but it
moves the object to the new API alone, and reading `allow_tf32` afterwards then
raises `RuntimeError: ... mix of the legacy and new APIs to set the TF32 status
for cublas matmul`. Setting `allow_tf32` repairs that state, so it is the setter
to reach for if either API has already been touched.

`torch_fl`'s own CI pins `TORCH_ALLOW_TF32_CUBLAS_OVERRIDE=0` in
`.github/configs/metax.yml` (`integration_environment`), so the MetaX
integration job measures fp32 rather than TF32.
`tests/integration/test_dtype_coverage.py` holds the resulting precision to 1e-5
relative, which fails if that pin is dropped. MetaX is the platform those two
cases were measured on. Ascend is the one backend that cannot meet the bound and
does not claim to — its cube takes HF32 by request, the switch the
`MM_RTOL`/`MM_ATOL` comment in `tests/integration/test_ops.py` and issue #409 are
about — so they are xfailed there. No other platform was measured; what the
cases rest on for them is their own code, not a routing table: the FlagGems
`mm`/`bmm` pass `allow_tf32=False` to `tl.dot` explicitly, and MUSA's `mudnn`
handle is refreshed from `at::globalContext().allowTF32CuBLAS()` on every call.

## Troubleshooting

### Import Error: `undefined symbol` from libtorch

**Cause:** Import order violation — `import torch` occurred before `import torch_fl`, so the cudart shim was not loaded.

**Fix:** Always `import torch_fl` first in your scripts.

### Runtime Error: `device count mismatch`

**Cause:** `torch.cuda.device_count()` and `torch.flagos.device_count()` differ, indicating the MACA runtime or driver is not correctly initialized.

**Fix:** Verify `/opt/maca` is present and accessible. Check `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` does not override MACA runtime paths.

### `import torch_fl` fails with configuration errors or missing libraries

**Cause:** the MetaX-specific import-time setup (libtorch relink, `torch.cuda`
shim) did not run.

**Fix:** confirm the wheel was built for MetaX (`FLAGOS_ACCELERATOR=metax`, recorded at
build time) and that the vendor torch is reachable through
`FLAGOS_VENDOR_TORCH_LIB` or the bundled `lib_maca/`. No mode environment variable
is involved any more.

### Wheel Too Large for PyPI

**Expected behavior.** The bundled forked libtorch causes the wheel to exceed PyPI's 100 MB limit (~1.1 GB). Distribute via a private package index or direct file transfer.

### FlagGems: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flag_gems'`

**Cause:** `backends_metax.conf` routes 592 ops to the FlagGems Python path by default — 591 leaf ops plus the `scaled_dot_product_attention` composite described in *FlagGems on MetaX* — and `csrc/aten/backends/flagos/python_op_caller.cc:GetFunc` resolves each kernel by `getattr` on `flag_gems` at dispatch time. Without the package those routes raise rather than fall back to boxing. The composite is the one route that can be turned off without the package: `FLAGOS_OP_scaled_dot_product_attention=cuda` returns it to the CUDA boxing kernel and leaves every other route alone.

**Fix:** Install FlagGems and a MetaX FlagTree Triton as shown in *FlagGems on MetaX* above. When reusing a copy that is already on the machine, check that it resolves the names rather than that it reports a version: an editable source tree reports `flag_gems.__version__ == "0.0.0"`.
