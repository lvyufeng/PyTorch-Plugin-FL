    -0, inf and nan.

    It is spelled with FlagGems' own ``mul`` rather than ``torch.mul`` so the
    whole op stays on FlagGems Triton kernels. That is a deliberate ~50 us: the
    conf routes ``mul.Tensor`` to the CUDA-boxing path, whose kernel is about
    twice as fast on fp32, and taking it would move a routed op off FlagGems,
    which is what this patch exists to avoid.

    ``flag_gems.mul`` is read at call time rather than captured here, because
    this function can run in the middle of ``import flag_gems``. Triton asks for
    the active device while ``flag_gems/__init__.py`` is still importing
    ``flag_gems.fused``, that query goes through the PrivateUse1 lazy init back
    into ``_lazy_init``, and the top-level names -- ``mul`` among them -- are not
    bound until ``from flag_gems.ops import *`` a few lines later, so on that
    first pass there is nothing to capture. By the time anything is dispatched
    ``flag_gems.mul`` is the function the bridge would have called, so binding it
    late costs a dict lookup and removes the ordering question entirely.

    Reached through ``flag_gems.pow_tensor_scalar`` rather than through the
    defining module, because those are two different functions here: the
    backend override is what the C++ bridge resolves, and upstream's copy is

    index_put_ -> self.copy_(self_cpu)``, and they are in the codegen's

    a ``Tensor?[]`` index list has no ``IValueToPython`` conversion, so no
    generated kernel can be handed to the bridge. FlagGems ships the op as a
    Triton kernel, so the round-trip is a per-call cost with no coverage reason
    behind it.

    Measured on a DCU bw1000, in the Qwen-Image-2.1 denoise loop, where the op
    is the largest exclusive entry in the steady-state census (24 calls over
    four steps at 15501.54 us each, ahead of every FlagGems op), against
    FlagGems' kernel on the same shapes with fresh operands:

        shape                                       round-trip   FlagGems
        (4122,) <- (4096,)              int            0.140 ms    0.155 ms
        (4122,) <- (4096,)              bool mask      0.173 ms    0.507 ms
        (4122,) <- scalar                              0.150 ms    0.153 ms
        (1,4122) <- (26,)                              0.085 ms    0.180 ms
        (1,4122,4096) [:, i] <- (4096,4096)      f32   68.583 ms    0.291 ms

        (1,4122,4096) [:, m] <- (4096,4096)      bf16  43.442 ms    0.578 ms

    The census mean is over that bimodal set: the model issues six calls a step
    -- five narrow ones that are a wash either way, and one wide
    ``joint_hidden_states[:, image_pad_mask] = hidden_states`` that is 70 of
    the step's ~93 ms. The win is on the wide shapes, and it is 75x-236x there.
    All of them agree bitwise with the round-trip (``equal=True``,
    ``max|delta|=0``, the same for ``accumulate=True``); the operand transfers
    and the CPU scatter are each tens of microseconds when timed on their own,
    so what the wide shapes cost is the round-trip, not the data.

    End to end, on the same six-step driver, against the run that differs only
    by this patch: the op falls from 15501.54 to 388.79 us per call on the
    steady block and from 16720.84 to 381.17 on the last step, the steady step
    wall from 1.272 to 1.180 s, and the last step's exclusive sum by 0.093 s --
    against 0.098 s for the op alone, so nothing else moved. The rendered image
    is byte-identical to the unpatched one (md5 6fc5c62c451ecf5772f11bb0e1652cfd,
    1875231 bytes, both).

    Narrows to FlagGems rather than away from it: the op keeps Triton kernels
    and never takes the CUDA-boxing route. Scoped to the configuration that was
    measured -- DCU, on a conf that routes to FlagGems -- and installed through
    ``torch.library`` rather than in C++ because the route cannot be stated in
    the conf: the conf enumerates the generated registration list, which this
    hand-registered op is deliberately not in. Upstream workaround rather than a
    design; remove it once the wrapper stops round-tripping. Best-effort, like
    ``_align_flaggems_device_identity``: an unpatched ``index_put_`` is slow

    ``@triton.autotune`` (``num_warps`` 4/8/16 from the vendor's
    ``tune_configs.yaml``). Triton benchmarks all three on the first call for
    each tuning key and keeps the winner in ``Autotuner.cache``, which is in
    memory and therefore per process. The kernel itself is compiled once and
    cached on disk, so a fresh process re-pays for a decision that cannot have
    changed.

    The knob gates the disk cache in both directions, not just the lookup.
    ``triton/runtime/autotuner.py:262`` only reaches ``check_disk_cache`` when
    ``self.cache_results`` was set at construction from
    ``knobs.autotuning.cache``, and ``check_disk_cache`` is also what *writes*
    the entry -- with the knob off the benchmarks run and nothing at all is
    remembered between processes. This is therefore a prerequisite for the
    cache existing, not a preference for reading it.

    The disk lookup hashes the Triton build, the backend target, the tuning key,
    the config list and the cache-invalidating environment variables, so a stale
    entry cannot survive a compiler or configuration change.

    Qwen-Image-2.1 issues exactly two tuning keys over a whole run --
    ``(4122, 4096)`` and ``(4096, 4096)``, measured at 0.38 s and 0.47 s -- so
    this is 0.85 s paid once per process, on a model whose steady-state denoise
    step is 1.098 s on the vendor build and 1.173 s on this one. It is a startup
    cost, not a per-step one: nothing here closes the 6.8% step gap, and the
    arms above are the whole of the claim.

    Set both ways on purpose. The environment variable is the knob Triton
    documents and is what a user would set, but ``triton.knobs`` reads it once,
    when the knob objects are constructed, which has already happened by the
    time this runs; the constructed knob is therefore written directly as well.

    An explicit ``TRITON_CACHE_AUTOTUNING=0`` -- a user who wants the benchmark
    back, or who is chasing an autotune that settled on a config they disagree
    with -- is left alone. It has to be read deliberately rather than left to
    ``setdefault``: ``env_bool`` is a data descriptor whose ``__set__`` calls
    ``knobs.setenv``, so assigning the knob *writes the variable*, and a
    ``setdefault`` followed by that assignment overwrites the user's ``0`` with
    the ``1`` it just wrote. The existing value is therefore parsed with the same
    ``getenv_bool`` that ``env_bool.get`` uses, so the two agree by construction.

    Scoped to the configuration it was measured on -- DCU, on a conf that routes
    to FlagGems -- like the patches around it. No op changes route and no kernel
    changes: the config selected is the one FlagGems' own tuner would have
    picked. Best-effort, like its neighbours: an unset knob is slow here, not

    compiles first -- for Qwen-Image-2.1 that is FlagGems' embedding, in the
    text encoder, or the layer-norm autotune in the denoise loop, depending on
    which side is reached first. It sha256s every file under ``triton/compiler``,
    ``triton/backends`` and ``triton/language`` and then the whole of
    ``libtriton.<ext>`` in 1 MiB chunks.

    On the DTK 6.3 wheel that .so is 900,284,304 bytes. Measured with the venv's
    own python, importing only ``triton.runtime.cache``:

        import triton.runtime.cache    0.196 s
        triton_key()                   1.013 s   (1694 characters later)

    and the same second shows up inside the model: the loop's first step is
    3030.0 ms of enqueue against 254.0 ms on the second, and ``get_cache_key``
    accounts for 1.325 s of a first-step profile in which one ``triton_key``
    call is 1.085 s. The lru_cache makes it a once-per-process cost, so it is
    paid in full by every run.

    Nothing about the value depends on this process -- it is a function of the
    installed files and ``triton.__version__`` alone, with no environment term
    in it -- so it can be computed at any point, and there is nothing to
    invalidate if it is computed early. It is started here, at device init,
    because the caller still has tens of seconds of work in front of it: the
    pipeline materialises ~33 GB of weights before the first Triton kernel is
    reached. ``hashlib`` releases the GIL for buffers this size and so do the

    Every FlagGems elementwise op is a generated wrapper around a Triton kernel
    launched through ``flag_gems.utils.libentry.LibEntry``, and on a DCU bw1000
    the host side of that, not the kernel, is what a launch costs. In the
    Qwen-Image-2.1 denoise loop the FlagGems pointwise ops are 402 ms of the
    837 ms of exclusive host time across four steady steps -- ``where`` 196 ms
    over 520 calls, ``pow`` 61, ``tanh`` 58, ``rsqrt`` 56, ``silu`` 31 -- where
    the vendor build spends 34.94 us on each ``where`` against FlagGems'
    376.48. The kernels are not what differs: on that shape the FlagGems
    ``where`` kernel is 74.0 us of device time against 62.1 for the vendor's,
    while the enqueue is 262.4 us against 11.5 -- a launch cost, not a kernel
    cost.

    What is left is Python that recomputes per launch what the kernel fixed at
    construction: ``LibEntry.run`` re-derives which arguments are specialised,
    not-specialised and constexpr, builds a name-keyed ``OrderedDict`` from that
    walk and then walks the signature a second time to put the arguments back in
    order; ``LibEntry.key`` rebuilds two closures per call and re-resolves the
    vendor's tensor-specialisation hook per argument; and
    ``_descriptor_cache_key``, which ``key`` calls once per argument, re-imports
    a module each time. None of it can observe anything that changed between two
    launches of the same kernel on the same shapes.

    The saving is not confined to the ops named above, because every FlagGems
    launch in the loop goes through that same ``LibEntry``. The routed
    composites drop with the elementwise ops -- ``native_layer_norm`` 204.31 to
    169.88 us per call, ``tanh`` 226.51 to 212.80, ``rsqrt`` 216.23 to 202.41,
    ``silu`` 220.45 to 204.89 -- and the steady block's exclusive sum with them,
    0.837 s to 0.767 s.

    That sum is host time, and the steady step on this model is device-bound, so
    the four-step wall does not move with it (1.179 s to 1.178 s; the vendor
    build is at 1.098 s). This is a host-budget change, and the host budget is
    what bounds a launch-bound stretch of the run rather than one already
    hidden behind the device queue.

    Scoped to the configuration it was measured on -- DCU, on a conf that routes
    to FlagGems -- and installed the way the patches around it are: by rebinding
    the functions in the FlagGems modules the C++ bridge and the generated
    wrappers reach them through. No op changes route; the kernels, the grids and
    the cache keys stay the ones FlagGems computes. Upstream workaround rather
    than a design; remove it once FlagGems stops doing this work per launch.

        There should only be one.

    Which drivers exist is a property of the Triton *build*, not of the host.
    FlagTree ships every backend it was built with in one wheel, so the Ascend

    FlagTree's Ascend backend answers its host-runtime questions -- the version
    hash in the compile cache key, the JIT'd launcher's compiler flags and
    includes, current device and current stream -- from a strategy registry
    keyed by a "backend policy" string, and it selects that policy by trying
    ``import torch_npu``. torch_fl publishes a torch_npu stub for FlagGems'
    benefit, so the import succeeds, the ``torch_npu`` policy is selected, and
    the first FlagGems kernel dies on the stub's missing surface
    (``torch_npu.version``) -- or, one step further in, on
    ``#include <torch_npu/...>`` and ``-ltorch_npu`` in the generated launcher,
    neither of which exists without the real extension.

    torch_fl carries a ``flagos`` policy for exactly this
    (``torch_fl.compile.flagtree_ascend_policy``), but it was only installed on
    the ``torch.compile`` path. FlagGems launches Triton kernels eagerly, so it
    has to be installed here as well, before any kernel runs.

    No-op unless the active Triton is FlagTree's Ascend build *and* FlagGems is
    installed -- the policy exists only for FlagGems' kernels, and a build whose
    registry no longer matches this shim must not take down device init for
    someone who never imports FlagGems.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: on a FlagTree Ascend build that has FlagGems but whose
            backend cannot take the flagos policy. FlagGems could not run
            there at all, and the message from ``install_policy`` names the
            reason, unlike the torch_npu AttributeError it would otherwise
            surface as, per op.
