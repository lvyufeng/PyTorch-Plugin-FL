"""Profiler parity: flagos's chrome trace must match torch-cuda's structure.

Locks in the profiler work: a vendor-agnostic device tracer, correlation and
flow wiring, and full kernel/memcpy/memset/runtime metadata including occupancy.
The reference is ``tests/data/profiler_cuda_baseline.json``, captured from stock
torch+cuda by ``tests/data/gen_profiler_baseline.py``.

Everything here asserts on STRUCTURE, never on counts or durations. This runs on
a shared GPU where both drift between runs, so "exactly 18 flow arrows" would
flake; "every flow arrow is paired" would not.

This file also carries forward the checks proven in the one-shot verification
gate ``tests/scratch/verify_correlation_foundation.py``, which was deleted once
these tests existed -- this is now their only home.

Run:
    PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) bash scripts/with_cuda_libtorch.sh \
        python -m pytest tests/integration/test_profiler_parity.py -v -m main_ops

    """Assertion 6: no device or runtime event escapes the capture window.

    Ported from the deleted ``tests/scratch/verify_correlation_foundation.py``'s
    ``window_containment`` (Task 1 finding 5). The bug it guards:
    ``processTrace``'s ``[startTime, endTime]``
    window was originally ignored outright, so the trace carried activity from
    before profiling even started -- measured at 66 of 258 runtime events ending
    before the first cpu_op, including a 250ms entry inside a 157ms span. The
    filter now lives at ``csrc/profiler/flagos_kineto_profiler.cc`` (``in_window``
    in the 4-arg ``processTrace``); this is what proves it still runs.

    THE WINDOW IS THE ``cat == "Trace"`` SPAN, not the cpu_op extent. That
    distinction is the whole reason this check is subtle: the cpu_op extent ends
    at the last op, while the real window runs on to profiler stop, so a
    perfectly legitimate trailing launch (the closing cudaDeviceSynchronize,
    measured landing ~30us after the final cpu_op) reads as a violation against
    the cpu_op proxy. Take the LONGEST span -- more than one may be emitted.

    SEMANTICS: strict CONTAINMENT (every event lies wholly within the window),
    not the interval OVERLAP the original asserted. Three reasons:

    1. It is what libkineto's own ``outOfRange`` rule means, so it matches what a
       trace consumer expects of the file.
    2. It is strictly stronger -- it catches everything overlap catches, plus an
       event only partly inside.
    3. Overlap has a vacuity hole that containment closes for free: an event long
       enough to straddle the *entire* window is neither "entirely before" nor
       "entirely after", so it passes an overlap test trivially. The original had
       to bolt on a separate ``longest <= window width`` heuristic to cover
       exactly that. Under containment, ``ts >= lo and ts + dur <= hi`` implies
       ``dur <= hi - lo``, so the heuristic is subsumed and no longer needed.

    Measured before adopting it: containment holds on real traces with room to
    spare -- 3 captures, 271 tracked events each, zero violations, the tightest
    margins being ~1.0-1.7ms at the start and ~30us at the end.

    Note the assertion is deliberately STRONGER than the C++ predicate, which is
    an overlap test (``end_ns >= startTime && start_ns <= endTime``). A straddling
    activity would therefore be emitted by the filter and rejected here. That has
    not been observed, and the end-side margin is structural (profiler stop
    necessarily follows the last runtime call it profiles). If this ever does fail
    by a small straddle at the window *start*, read it as a finding about a
    genuinely in-flight activity at profiler start -- report it rather than
    quietly relaxing this back to overlap.
