    """Pick the op-routing config file for this build.

    Every conf is backends_<platform>.conf -- one file per platform, no per-mode
    suffix -- so the selection is a property of the build, not of an env var:

      * a native-kernel vendor marker -> backends_<that platform>.conf
      * a MetaX build                 -> backends_metax.conf (boxing-only build)
      * a DCU build                   -> backends_dcu.conf
      * a PPU wheel                   -> backends_ppu.conf
      * otherwise                     -> backends_cuda.conf

    There is no FlagGems opt-in left to apply. FLAGOS_USE_FLAGGEMS,
    FLAGOS_USE_FLAGGEMS_CPP and FLAGOS_USE_TILEOPS each used to name a conf of
    their own; every one of those files was the platform's own conf with one
    backend column rewritten, which is why they could -- and did -- drift from it.
    Each conf now states all five keys per op directly
    (flaggems_cpp > flaggems > tileops > <vendor> > none), so the routing those
    flags used to select is already in the file the platform reads.

    Which entry point an op actually takes is then decided by what got compiled
    in, not by which file was read. flaggems_cpp is Backend::kFlagGemsCpp and needs
    FLAGOS_BUILD_FLAGGEMS_CPP=ON (liboperators.so built for the vendor); tileops is
    Backend::kTileOps and needs FLAGOS_BUILD_TILEOPS=ON plus an SM90 device. Where the
    slot is empty Dispatcher::GetFn degrades to the boxing kernel rather than
    raising, so one file stays correct across both builds. FLAGOS_FORCE_BACKEND
    survives as a table transform in common.cc (ApplyForcedBackend): the tileops
    mode repins every op the conf annotates `# tileops` onto that path, which is
    the same op set backends_tileops.conf used to carry.

    backends_metax.conf carries 15 of those ops on flaggems_cpp -- the 17 verified
    on-device intersected with the current C++ set. mm/mm.out are excluded
    deliberately: flag_gems' C++ mm_kernel_general requests 98304 bytes of shared
    memory and MetaX C550 provides 65536 (mcErrorInvalidValue at launch), so they
    stay on the cuda boxing kernel. Those 15 need a FlagGems built for MACA (cpp/
    -DFLAGGEMS_BACKEND=MACA) linked in; without it Dispatcher::GetFn sees an empty
    kFlagGemsCpp slot and boxes them, which is why one file is safe for both builds.

    Native-kernel vendors (musa, ascend, gcu, tsingmicro) do not take part in that
    choice; each takes backends_<platform>.conf directly. For musa, ascend and gcu
    that conf is generated full-coverage: every routable op appears exactly once,
    already resolved by the priority flaggems_cpp > flaggems > tileops > <vendor>
    > none, so operator support is countable from the file alone. tsingmicro stays
    hand-written and sparse because it registers the full generated op list rather
    than a subset -- a `none` entry there would reach the dispatcher and raise on
    an empty slot instead of boxing to cpu_fallback, so the whole-list shape is
    not available to it. Such a build is detected via lib/flagos_platform, or for
    Ascend via /dev/davinci* device nodes. To collapse that table onto a single
    backend family for A/B measurement, set FLAGOS_FORCE_BACKEND to flaggems,
    vendor or tileops -- one name, so "two of them at once" is unrepresentable.
    Every mode is applied in common.cc over the parsed table: an op only moves
    if the target backend actually implements it, known from the routed value
    plus its `# <backend>` annotation. Ops with no such implementation are
    listed on stderr and stay on their configured backend -- the vendor mode is
    therefore partial by nature, since a vendor implements far fewer ops than
    FlagGems.

    The two boxing confs (metax, dcu) are generated by the same script and have
    the same full-coverage shape as the vendor ones; only the fallback key
    differs, spelled `cuda` because a CUDA-compatible platform can box every op
    (which is why they have no `none` entries). Each routes the ops its own triton
    backend cannot run back to that boxing kernel instead of to flaggems:
    mm/bmm/mean.dim and friends on MetaX (maca libtorch_cuda), slice_backward
    (hardware VMFault) and silu_backward (missing div_rn lowering) on DCU under
    DTK's hcu triton. Those per-platform gap sets are measured on hardware, so the
    generator recovers them from the confs rather than restating them. An explicit
    FLAGOS_BACKEND_CONFIG always wins (advanced/testing use), and the per-op
    FLAGOS_OP_<name> overrides in common.cc still apply on top. This must run
    before the first op dispatch triggers BackendTable() init; setting it at
    import time (before any flagos tensor op) is well before that.

    The choice is handed to the C++ reader through
    _C._set_backend_config_path(), not written to os.environ. It used to be an
    environment write, which made the wheel's own selection indistinguishable
    from a user's for the rest of the process -- see backend_config_path().

      shim torch.cuda so FlagGems' Triton kernels can compile/run under CPU
      torch + external libtorch_cuda.so. GEMS_VENDOR=nvidia is REQUIRED so
      FlagGems' tl_extra_shim resolves triton.language.extra.cuda.libdevice
      (which has `pow`); otherwise it falls back to tl.math (no `pow`).
      Disable with FLAGOS_DISABLE_CUDA_SHIM=1.

    - MetaX (boxing + FlagGems): set GEMS_VENDOR=metax so FlagGems uses the
      MetaX codegen config (triton-metax backend, prefer_block_pointer=False to
      avoid the triton-metax block-pointer bug), and patch torch.cuda (device
      props + stream/availability) so FlagGems' Triton kernels run on the
      CPU-frozen torch wheel against maca's libtorch_cuda.so. Auto-selected on a
      MetaX build or with FLAGOS_METAX_COMPAT=1 when a MetaX
      card is present.

    - Hygon DCU (DTK): set GEMS_VENDOR=hygon so FlagGems uses its _hygon
      codegen config (triton hcu backend, triton_extra_name="hip"). No
      torch.cuda shim is needed -- DTK ships a hipified torch with a real,
      working torch.cuda. This branch must precede the generic-NVIDIA one:
      is_nvidia_cuda_available() is False on DTK (there is no libcuda.so, only
      libgalaxyhip), so without it DCU would reach the ascend fallback and get
      GEMS_VENDOR=ascend -- which also breaks the comm layer, since that vendor
      selects the HCCL profile (see comm/process_group.py _VENDOR_PROFILES).

    - Ascend: set GEMS_VENDOR=ascend so FlagGems uses the ASCEND codegen
      config (prefer_block_pointer=False, avoiding the Ascend Triton backend's
      tl.make_block_ptr bug), and register torch.flagos as a torch.npu shim so
      FlagGems' gen_torch_device_object('ascend') resolves correctly. This
      branch is taken only for an Ascend build or an explicit

    identity instead, and both silently change behaviour:

    ``torch.fx.graph.add_global`` carves out ``obj != torch.device`` so that a

    resolved through the ``device`` custom builtin. With the attribute swapped,

    the qualified-name HACK path meant for custom ops -- the name is never added
    to the module's globals, and the generated forward dies with
    ``NameError: name 'device' is not defined`` the moment it runs. It is
    ``torch.arange(..., device=x.device)`` that emits such a constant, which is
    how every HF model builds its position ids, so this took out essentially
    every transformer under ``torch.compile``.

    ``torch._dynamo.utils.common_constant_types`` holds the types Dynamo may
    wrap as a ``ConstantVariable``, and it is tested with ``type(obj) in ...``.
    Reading ``tensor.device`` while tracing then asserts with "Cannot construct
    ``ConstantVariable`` for value of type ``torch.device``".

      * the device *type* comes from ``torch._utils._get_available_device_type()``,
        which answers "cuda" before it ever asks privateuse1. So on PPU and MetaX
        (where ``torch.cuda.is_available()`` is shimmed True) a module on

        per device and never restores, so after the probe loop every later
        operation meant for device 0 runs on the last device probed.

    A flagos-placed module therefore builds its own state: devices counted and

    parallel_apply, gather -- and works once ``torch.nn.parallel.comm`` has

# ===========================================================================
# Import-time phase pipeline.
#
# torch_fl runs a fixed sequence of side effects at import. The order is
# load-bearing -- a wrong order produces a dlopen abort or a wrong-vendor build,
# not a Python exception -- so it lives in exactly one place here instead of
# being implied by where each statement happens to sit in the file.
#
#   1. conf          pick the op-routing config and stage the MetaX shim
#   2. preload       relink/preload the vendor libtorch and CUDA assets
#   3. claim         import torch, free PrivateUse1, load _C, install the device
#   4. vendor_compat install the vendor runtime shims and resolve GEMS_VENDOR
#   5. ecosystem     FlagGems prep, CUDA alias, distributed/DDP/DataParallel/
#                    compile/BPU
#
# Constraints, each next to the phase it constrains:
#   * preload before claim: the vendor libtorch has to be in place before
#     `import torch`, and the CUDA assets before _C is dlopened.
#   * within claim, the PrivateUse1 check precedes `import torch_fl._C`: the .so
#     registers the AutogradPrivateUse1 fallback at dlopen time, and a vendor
#     plugin that already claimed the key turns that into an uncatchable abort.
#   * claim before vendor_compat: FlagGems reads GEMS_VENDOR at its import, so
#     the shims and the vendor resolution must precede the ecosystem hooks.
#   * vendor_compat before ecosystem: the FlagGems/dist/compile hooks act on the
#     vendor surface the previous phase installed.
