"""Run HuggingFace's own tests for one model architecture on an accelerator.

This is a manual hardware measurement, not a pytest test: CI does not invoke
files in ``tests/manual``. Where ``transformers_model_probe.py`` builds a tiny
model and probes four layers of its own design, this runner executes the
assertions HuggingFace maintains for the architecture --- everything under
``tests/models/<module>/`` in the transformers source tree that matches the
installed wheel.

The unit of work is one architecture per invocation, in its own subprocess. A
sweep is an external loop. Accelerator faults are not contained: one illegal
memory access poisons the device context, after which every later test in the
same process fails with the same symptom, so a poisoned run is reported as one
finding for the model rather than as a list of independent failures.

Usage:
  python tests/manual/transformers_hf_tests.py --model qwen3
  python tests/manual/transformers_hf_tests.py --model qwen3 --out /tmp/qwen3.json
  python tests/manual/transformers_hf_tests.py --model blip-2 --collect-only
  python tests/manual/transformers_hf_tests.py --all --out /tmp/transformers-all.json
  python tests/manual/transformers_hf_tests.py --list-models

``--model`` runs every official test under one architecture directory. ``--all``
iterates all architecture keys exposed by the installed Transformers version,
with one isolated subprocess per architecture; it does not enumerate Hub
checkpoints or download model weights.

Issue filing is deliberately not part of this runner. It writes an auditable
JSON result that a later reporter consumes, so that executing tests and writing
to a shared tracker stay separable.
