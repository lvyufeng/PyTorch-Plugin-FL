"""The single access point for torch_fl's own ``FLAGOS_*`` environment variables.

Everything torch_fl reads from the environment goes through this module, so the
truth table is stated once instead of being re-invented at each call site. Before
this module existed there were a dozen parsers that disagreed: some accepted
anything that was not ``0`` (so ``off`` meant *on*), the profiler shims enabled
their logging on the *existence* of the variable (so ``=0`` turned it on), and
``ALL_USE_FLAGGEMS=off`` entered strict dispatch mode in C++ while leaving the
routing table alone in ``common.cc`` -- a pair of booleans that collided. That
pair is ``FLAGOS_FORCE_BACKEND`` now, one enum, so the disagreement is not
expressible rather than merely fixed.

Importing this module has no side effects beyond the one-shot scan described
under `check_environment`. It imports nothing from ``torch_fl`` and nothing from
``torch``, so it loads standalone — ``tests/unit/test_env_registry.py`` pulls it
in by path without a torch install.

The C++ mirror is ``csrc/include/flagos_env.h``; the two must stay in step.
