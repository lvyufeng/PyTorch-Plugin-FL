ProcessGroupFlagOS — a transparent ProcessGroup backend for flagos (PrivateUse1).

Architecture
------------
flagos tensors share physical GPU memory with CUDA tensors. This ProcessGroup
wraps an underlying comm backend (FlagCX if available, otherwise NCCL/HCCL)
and converts privateuseone tensors to the backend's expected device view inside
each collective virtual method. The Work objects returned are from the inner
backend, so callers (including the DDP Reducer) get properly typed futures.

Vendor selection is table-driven by GEMS_VENDOR (see ``_VENDOR_PROFILES``).
For every vendor the inner-backend priority is FlagCX first, then the vendor's
native backend (NCCL for CUDA-ABI vendors, HCCL for Ascend, MCCL for MUSA), and
finally a host-staged gloo backend, which needs no vendor library at all but pays
a device->host->device copy per collective (``_try_build_staged_gloo``). Set
``FLAGOS_DIST_STAGED_GLOO=0`` to decline that last tier and fail loudly instead.

Gloo requests
    ``"flagos"`` has to be asked for by name, and not every caller does.
    torch.distributed picks gloo for any device type it does not recognise, so
    ``init_process_group(backend="gloo")`` -- what torchrun and the
    transformers FSDP2 tests build on a flagos host -- lands on a
    ProcessGroupGloo, whose C++ collectives reject flagos tensors outright and
    cannot be extended from Python. ``redirect_gloo_requests`` therefore
    interposes on ``init_process_group`` / ``new_group`` and substitutes the
    flagos backend for a gloo request, but only when the process's accelerator
    is the flagos device, i.e. when gloo has nothing else to fall back on. Set
    ``FLAGOS_DIST_REDIRECT_GLOO=0`` to keep the requested backend.

View conversion
    flagos tensors on CUDA-ABI vendors
    (nvidia/metax/iluvatar/kunlunxin/du/thead/hygon)
    share physical GPU memory with CUDA, so they are reinterpreted as CUDA
    tensors via a zero-copy shared-storage view (``_C._flagos_to_cuda_view``)
    before being handed to NCCL / FlagCX-cuda. The underlying buffer is the
    same physical memory, so the backend's write-back is visible to the flagos
    side immediately. Vendors whose flagos tensor is NOT a cuda alias
    (ascend/musa/cambricon) have ``view=None`` in their profile and currently
    require the FlagCX path; see ``_resolve_view``.

GCU device guard
    Enflame GCU streams and pointers are device-scoped. The communicator must
    run on the same device as the tensor, or operations silently no-op. Every
    collective method on enflame applies a device guard that forces the current
    device to match the operand device before dispatch.

#
#   flagcx_dev   The device name FlagCX registers its "flagcx" backend under
#                (must match backend_flagcx.hpp flagcxBackendConstructor). For
#                CUDA-ABI vendors this is "cuda"; Ascend uses "cann", MUSA
#                "musa", Cambricon "mlu", etc.
#   view         Name of the torch_fl._C helper that reinterprets a flagos
#                (privateuseone) tensor as the physical tensor the comm backend
#                expects, or None when the flagos tensor is NOT a zero-copy
