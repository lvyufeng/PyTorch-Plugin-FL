"""The set_env_*.sh scripts must get their version pins from one file.

Each platform script used to hard-code the CPU-torch pin, the FlagTree index,
the FlagGems release and its FlagTree wheel -- so bumping a version meant
seven edits and it was easy to update six and miss one. Those values now live in
`.github/version-pins.env`, which every script sources. This checks the contract
holds: the pin file defines what the scripts read, and no script keeps a literal
copy of a shared pin as its fallback.

Pure text, no torch: the scripts cannot be executed here (they provision vendor
environments), but the pin wiring is fully visible in their source.
