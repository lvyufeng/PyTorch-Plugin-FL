# PPU (T-Head Jianwu ZW810E) environment bootstrap for CI.
#
# PPU is a CUDA-ABI boxing backend with its own FLAGOS_ACCELERATOR value: the toolchain
# is CUDA (PPU torch is a local USE_CUDA=1 build whose libtorch_cpu.so provides
# ~2092 undefined symbols of libtorch_fl.so), but the vendor is PPU, so the
# build bundles its libtorch into lib_ppu/. The stock CPU wheel's core libs must
# be replaced by the PPU build at import time. This script:
#   1. Validates PPU_SDK and the vendor torch assets.
#   2. Builds an isolated venv with stock CPU torch 2.10.0 (link target).
#   3. Installs the published FlagTree and FlagGems wheels into it.
#   4. Exports FLAGOS_ACCELERATOR=ppu + PPU_SDK + the two CUDA-assets kill switches.
#   5. build_ext --inplace, then bundles PPU core/CUDA/MKL .so into
#      torch_fl/lib_ppu/ via bundle_ppu_libtorch.sh (setup.py does not call it).
#
# Nothing here reads a host bind mount, so the environment is fully reproducible
# from the image plus this script's indexes.
#
# Core replacement itself is automatic at `import torch_fl` time, gated on
# lib_ppu/libtorch_cuda.so existing; the FLAGOS_ACCELERATOR value is what selects
# backends_ppu.conf. No mode env var is involved.

# pypi.org and download.pytorch.org, which CI was green on before). The PPU
# image's own pip.conf points at an internal mirror that 503s, so the explicit
# index-url here bypasses it. Both stay overridable via env: flip to the
# Tsinghua mirrors once the pod proxy allows them.

# --- Reaching a host around the runner's HTTP proxy --------------------------
# The runner injects HTTP(S)_PROXY into the job container along with its own
# allowlist and NO_PROXY list (this pod: localhost,127.0.0.1,10.1.12.192,
# 10.1.12.38,harbor.baai.ac.cn,.example.com). Two of those entries resolve to
# public addresses (harbor.baai.ac.cn is 120.92.122.200, the same /16 as
# resource.flagos.net), and the container is a NAT'd docker bridge off the
# runner host, so this pod does open public connections without the proxy.
# resource.flagos.net is simply not on that list: pip tunnels to it, the proxy
# refuses the CONNECT, and pip reports 'Tunnel connection failed: 500 Internal
# Server Error' as "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement
# flagtree===" -- an unreachable index that reads like a missing wheel. The
# 2026-09-15 run spent all five pip_retry attempts and 21 minutes on that, while
# the sibling MUSA runner's proxy serves the same index fine, so the working
# route is a property of the pod rather than of the index.
#
# So probe the unproxied route and, when it answers, add just that host to
# NO_PROXY/no_proxy: pip's requests stack reads either case, git reads the
# lowercase one through libcurl. When the probe fails the environment is left
# exactly as the runner set it, so a pod that can only leave through the proxy
# keeps the previous behaviour instead of trading a 500 for a connect timeout.
