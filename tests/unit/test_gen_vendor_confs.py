"""Unit coverage for scripts/gen_vendor_confs.py.

The generator turns shared FlagGems coverage sources plus each platform's own
conf into one full-coverage conf per platform, where every op torch_fl can route
is listed exactly once as `flaggems_cpp`, `flaggems`, `tileops`,
`<vendor>`/`cuda` or `none`. Stating `none` explicitly is the point: "absent
from the file" and "known to be unsupported" used to look identical, so operator
support could not be counted and sparse confs rotted silently against a growing
codegen.

The load-bearing property is that **a conf cannot claim more than the platform
registers**. FlagGems coverage is measured on CUDA, so it is a ceiling, not a
per-platform routing set: the FlagGems wrapper is reached through the op's
PrivateUse1 registration, so routing an unregistered op to `flaggems` names a
kernel no call arrives at while the file reports it as covered. Vendor
registration sets are therefore read from the generated `*_register.inc` files
csrc/aten/register.cc includes -- the same list the compiler sees --
and test_vendor_routing_never_exceeds_registration pins the containment.

That also decides which platforms get a generated conf at all. `none` boxes to
cpu_fallback only where registration *skips* the op; metax, tsingmicro and dcu
register the full generated list, so `none` there would raise instead. They are
either boxing platforms (fallback `cuda`, no `none`) or hand-written.

For boxing platforms the generator still reads the file it rewrites, so two
measured sets have to survive the round trip:

  * the triton gap set, spelled `cuda` on an op FlagGems covers (MetaX
    Xnack/ATU faults, DCU hcu VMFault);
  * the measured FlagGems-C++ subset, which is NOT the shared fg_cpp set --
    backends_metax_flaggems_cpp.conf verifies 17 of 18 on-device and
    deliberately keeps `mm` boxed.

Both are sets the generator could plausibly re-derive from shared sources, and
doing so would silently reroute working kernels. These tests pin them.
