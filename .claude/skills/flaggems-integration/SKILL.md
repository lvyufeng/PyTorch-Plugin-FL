# FlagGems integration (torch_fl)

## Scope and prerequisites

FlagGems is a portable compiler-kernel path. It is an optional layer on top of
an already working device runtime and operator path; it does not replace device
allocation, streams, copies, synchronization, or vendor-native compatibility
work.

Complete these first:

- [[runtime-bringup]] — the device and allocator contract must pass on hardware.
- [[torch-version-port]] — generated ATen bindings must match the active torch
  minor line.
- [[cuda-compat-vendor]] — for a CUDA-shaped vendor, establish the boxing path
  before adding FlagGems. FlagGems and CUDA boxing may coexist per operator.
- [[native-op-backend]] — for a native vendor, establish the native backend and
  its fallback policy before routing additional operators to FlagGems.

The integration has three separate surfaces:

| Surface | Source of truth | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Python kernels | `flag_gems._FULL_CONFIG` plus `scripts/codegen_ops.py` | Discovers compatible gems, emits wrappers, and registers `flagos_python` routes |
| C++ kernels | `csrc/aten/flaggems_cpp_kernels.cc` and generated registration | Routes the small explicit C++ FlagGems set without the Python GIL |
| Runtime selection | `torch_fl/__init__.py` and `torch_fl/configs/backends_*.conf` | Selects the platform config and installs the chosen dispatch registrations |

A route is only a candidate for testing. The support verdict comes from cases
that execute correctly against a CPU reference.

## Step 1 — identify the vendor/compiler environment

Keep the active torch environment and the vendor compiler environment explicit.
The Python torch used to build torch_fl must match the branch's minor line. Do
not replace a CPU-only torch with a vendor CUDA torch merely to make FlagGems
import or Triton discovery succeed.

Record these values before changing code:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import sys
import torch
print("python", sys.version)
print("torch", torch.__version__)
print("cuda", torch.version.cuda)
print("hip", torch.version.hip)
try:
    import flag_gems
    print("flag_gems", getattr(flag_gems, "__version__", "unknown"))
    print("full_config", len(flag_gems._FULL_CONFIG))
except Exception as exc:
    print("flag_gems import failed:", repr(exc))
PY

python -m pip show torch flag_gems triton 2>/dev/null || true
```

For a vendor box, also record the vendor Triton/compiler version, Python ABI,
SDK/runtime revision, device model, driver, and any required environment such
as `GEMS_VENDOR`, `XPU_ENABLE_PROFILER_TRACING`, or a vendor library path.
Vendor `PYTHONPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` must not silently inject a second
PyTorch or Triton into a CPU-only codegen environment. Use an explicit wrapper
or a clean shell and print the resolved paths:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import importlib.util
for name in ("torch", "flag_gems", "triton"):
    spec = importlib.util.find_spec(name)
    print(name, spec.origin if spec else "not found")
PY
```

A Python ABI mismatch, a failed `flag_gems` import, or an unresolved vendor
compiler is an environment failure. Stop the integration run and record it;
do not accept an empty generated Python-kernel file as a successful result.

## Step 2 — discover and classify the Python surface

`scripts/codegen_ops.py` reads the installed torchgen schemas and discovers
FlagGems functions from `flag_gems._FULL_CONFIG`. The generator filters a gem
by schema compatibility, positional/keyword arity, supported type annotations,
`out` behavior, and known recursive or RNG cases. Never hand-copy the complete
FlagGems config into a torch-fl config.

Run discovery in the exact environment that will build the generated files:

```bash
FLAGOS_CODEGEN_ALL=1 python scripts/codegen_ops.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/flaggems-codegen.log
! grep -E 'SKIP|WARN|\[flaggems\] import failed' /tmp/flaggems-codegen.log
```

If CUDA boxing is used, the external CUDA assets may be preloaded only through
the repository's wrapper, while the active Python torch remains CPU-only:

```bash
FLAGOS_CODEGEN_ALL=1 bash scripts/with_cuda_libtorch.sh \
  python scripts/codegen_ops.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/flaggems-codegen.log
```

Inspect the resulting counts and keep them with the run evidence:

```bash
grep -E 'flaggems|generated|route|SKIP|WARN' /tmp/flaggems-codegen.log || true
wc -l csrc/aten/generated/flaggems_python_kernels.cc
```

A generator change belongs in `scripts/codegen_ops.py` or its supporting
registry logic, not in generated C++ or config files. Regenerate all affected
artifacts together, including `flaggems_python_kernels.cc`, `register.inc`, and
`torch_fl/configs/backends_*.conf`.

## Step 3 — make generation idempotent

Compare complete generated patches, not the working tree against the branch
base: a valid torch or FlagGems version change is expected to produce a diff.
Run the generator twice in the same isolated environment:

```bash
git diff --binary > /tmp/flaggems-codegen-1.patch
FLAGOS_CODEGEN_ALL=1 python scripts/codegen_ops.py \
  > /tmp/flaggems-codegen-second.log 2>&1
! grep -E 'SKIP|WARN|\[flaggems\] import failed' /tmp/flaggems-codegen-second.log
git diff --binary > /tmp/flaggems-codegen-2.patch
cmp -s /tmp/flaggems-codegen-1.patch /tmp/flaggems-codegen-2.patch \
  && echo "FlagGems codegen is idempotent"
```

If the second patch differs, find whether the cause is unordered discovery,
unstable generated config ordering, a timestamp/path, or a mutable FlagGems
registry. Fix the generator and repeat. Record the exact torch, FlagGems, and
Triton versions because generated output is input-version-specific.

## Step 4 — wire and select the backend

Python FlagGems routes use `flagos_python`; the C++ path uses the explicit
FlagGems C++ backend. Check both sides of every route:

```bash
python tests/integration/ops/test_flaggems_conf_consistency.py -v
```

The runtime config is selected by `torch_fl/__init__.py`:

- `FLAGOS_USE_FLAGGEMS=1` selects the generic Python config.
- `FLAGOS_USE_FLAGGEMS_CPP=1` selects the explicit C++ config.
- Platform-specific combinations select the MetaX, DCU, or other vendor config.
- A platform config must not claim a Python route that its compiler cannot run.

For a new platform, prefer an allowlist config over the generic one. Generate
the platform config from an explicit set of overloads that already have measured
CPU-reference evidence on that chip, and route every other generated operator to
the platform's fallback backend. The generic config is a candidate route table
produced from `flag_gems._FULL_CONFIG`; shipping it as a platform default
promotes unmeasured routes into the default dispatch path, where a vendor
compiler failure becomes a user-visible regression instead of a boxing call.
Expand the allowlist only from new survey data, and keep the allowlist in the
generator so the config stays reproducible:

```python
# in scripts/codegen_ops.py, next to the other generated config writers
<platform>_verified_flaggems = {"add.Tensor", "cos"}  # measured overloads only
backend = "flagos_python" if op in <platform>_verified_flaggems else "cuda"
```

Pin the allowlist in `tests/integration/ops/test_flaggems_conf_consistency.py`
so an accidental widening fails in CI, and assert that each allowlisted route has
a generated Python kernel.

Follow the existing config pattern and keep the generated block clearly
identified. Ensure that:

1. every `flagos_python` route has a generated wrapper and dispatcher;
2. C++ routes are disjoint from Python routes unless the dispatch priority is
   intentional and tested;
3. unsupported dtypes and unsupported vendor operations fall back according to
   the platform policy rather than silently changing tensor device semantics;
4. the selected `GEMS_VENDOR` and Triton backend are compatible with the chip;
5. importing torch_fl with FlagGems disabled remains clean.

Do not add a handwritten per-operator kernel to bypass a generator limitation.
If the vendor API cannot be expressed by FlagGems, route that operator through
the CUDA-compatible or native backend and document the boundary.

## Step 5 — handle RNG and state explicitly

FlagGems RNG must be tested as a stateful interface, not only for numerical
shape. For each platform, determine whether generator-less calls use a shared
seed/offset stream and whether explicit generators remain isolated. Include
`rand`, `randn`, `randperm`, `random_`, `bernoulli`, and at least one `*_like` or
factory overload available in the active torch schema.

Use the repository RNG tests where available:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/ops/test_rng_dispatch.py -q
```

If this suite fails or crashes on the target, that is an open finding, not a
detail to omit. A focused seed-replay probe passing does not substitute for the
suite: record the suite as unvalidated for that platform in the support report
and the PR, and keep FlagGems RNG out of the platform's claimed scope.

Attribute the failures before reporting them. Run the suite with FlagGems on and
off, and once at the branch base; only a delta is caused by the change under
review. Report counts and the crashing test by name, not just "fails and
segfaults" — a later upstream commit may skip the exact test named, which
silently invalidates the wording.

A whole-cohort gate on `FLAGOS_USE_FLAGGEMS` is wrong under an allowlist config.
Tests that assert FlagGems-specific behavior for one operator must read that
operator's route out of `FLAGOS_BACKEND_CONFIG`, because the switch can be on
while that operator stays on the vendor path.

Then run a focused mixed-route probe. Verify same-seed replay, different-seed
sensitivity, stream advancement across repeated calls, explicit-generator
isolation, and replay after mixing FlagGems with a native or CUDA route. A
successful call with the wrong stream or a reset generator is a correctness
failure.

## Step 6 — validate cases against CPU

Routing presence and import success are not operator support.

Before trusting any survey result, confirm that the loaded extension is the one
built from the current source. A stale worktree or an older copied
`torch_fl/lib` produces a whole-cohort `<op>: backend not registered` result that
looks like a routing bug but is only an old shared library. When every route
fails identically, check the built artifact before changing the generator:

```bash
python -c "import torch_fl, torch_fl._C as c; print(torch_fl.__file__); print(c.__file__)"
grep -c KernelPython csrc/aten/generated/flaggems_python_kernels.cc
ls -l --time-style=full-iso torch_fl/lib/*.so build/CMakeCache.txt
grep -E 'FLAGGEMS_PYTHON|FLAGGEMS_KERNEL|CUDA_KERNEL' build/CMakeCache.txt
```

If `FLAGGEMS_PYTHON` was `OFF` in the build that produced the loaded library, the
run is not evidence at all: discard it and rebuild. The generated source
containing `<Op>KernelPython` and a matching `REGISTER_IMPL_TO_DISPATCHER` proves
only that the source is correct, never that the loaded binary contains it.

Then start with the small dispatch suite, and run the manual overload survey on
each affected hardware platform:

```bash
python tests/integration/ops/test_flaggems_conf_consistency.py -v
python -m pytest tests/integration/ops/ -m "flaggems or flaggems_python" -q

python tests/manual/flaggems_overload_survey.py \
  --conf torch_fl/configs/backends_flaggems.conf \
  --out /tmp/flaggems-overloads.json
```

Survey the config the platform actually selects at runtime. When the platform
ships an allowlist config, pass it with `--conf`; a generic-config survey
measures routes the platform will never take. To decide what belongs in the
allowlist, survey the generic config once as an exploratory pass, then promote
only the overloads that came back `STRICT` or `BASIC_ONLY`.

Typical vendor-compiler failures at this stage are properties of the vendor
Triton stack, not of the routing table, and each one means the operator stays on
the fallback backend: a kernel launch rejected by the driver, a Triton
`OutOfResources` for a vendor SRAM limit, a compiler assertion or abort in the
vendor LLVM backend, and a gem that re-enters an `out=` overload that the active
config did not register.

The survey first rejects synthesized inputs that fail on CPU. Recompute each
operator verdict from the remaining cases:

- `STRICT`: every CPU-valid case passed;
- `BASIC_ONLY`: at least one passed and at least one failed;
- `FAILED`: valid cases existed and none passed;
- `UNTESTED`: no CPU-valid synthesized case existed.

Keep case-level `ERROR`, `WRONG`, `CRASH`, and `TIMEOUT` separate from operator
verdicts. Re-run crashes with the correct runtime environment before counting
them. A runtime startup failure is not an operator result.

For each claimed platform, capture the hardware model, run date, torch/FlagGems/
Triton revisions, config and active route-set hashes, survey harness version,
profiles per overload, raw JSON, and aggregate counts. If hardware is absent,
mark the row **not revalidated**. Do not copy another platform's rate.

A platform measured on an allowlist config is a separate cohort. Report it in its
own row with its own denominator, state that denominator explicitly, and say in
the table note that the generic cohort remains not revalidated on that hardware.
Never merge an allowlist result into a generic-cohort rate, and re-check the row's
cell count against the header after editing the table.

## Step 7 — update evidence and review the boundary

Update `docs/reference/operator-support.md` in the same change when routing or
implementation changes. Keep generic FlagGems overload results separate from
native routes such as Ascend, GCU, or vendor-specific kernels. Update the
platform installation guide with prerequisites, environment isolation, build
flags, and the measured command.

Before opening a PR, verify:

- `flag_gems` imported successfully in the generation environment;
- no `SKIP`, `WARN`, or hidden import failure occurred;
- the second generator run produced an identical patch;
- config consistency passed;
- RNG state and mixed-route behavior passed where supported;
- the survey JSON and aggregate arithmetic agree;
- unavailable hardware is labeled **not revalidated**;
- the surveyed config is the one the platform selects at runtime, and the loaded
  extension was built from the committed source with the intended build flags;
- regenerated artifacts caused by a torch/FlagGems environment change are either
  reviewed as part of this change or split into a separate codegen-only change,
  never mixed in unexplained;
- `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .` pass;
- no vendor runtime, driver, XMLIR, or Python environment was copied into a
  wheel without a measured minimal dependency set;
- all generated artifacts and the generator/config source change are committed.

FlagGems is ready to claim only the measured scope. A larger route table, a
successful import, or a passing smoke test is not evidence for a larger support
rate.
