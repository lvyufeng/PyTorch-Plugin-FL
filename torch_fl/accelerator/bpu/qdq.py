"""Insert QuantizeLinear/DequantizeLinear pairs into a float ONNX graph.

hbdk4 lowers a conv to the BPU only when its input type is si8/si16. Wrapping
each eligible op's inputs in a Q/DQ pair is what communicates that, and the
compiler's own frontend maps those to `qnt.quantize`.

Constraints imposed by hbdk4's frontend (see onnx/opset13.py::QuantizeLinear):
scale and zero_point must be constant initializers, and the target type must be
signed. Violating any of them raises at export time, not compile time.

#
# They need the *input* quantized and nothing else. Without this the ResNet stem
# max-pool was the one op in the whole network running on the CPU inside the

# of this pass produce different artifacts -- without it, adding MaxPool above
# silently reused the artifact compiled before it, and the measurement showed no
# change at all.

# Version 3: BF16 boundary promotion. Frozen BF16 weights are converted to F32
# before export, so previously cached artifacts with BF16 initializers must not
