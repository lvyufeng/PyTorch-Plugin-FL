"""The set_env_*.sh scripts share one helper library.

`pip_retry`, `flag_gems_installed`, `install_flag_gems`, `strip_vendor_paths`
and `venv_is_usable` used to be copied into every platform script -- `pip_retry`
in five slightly different spellings -- so a fix had to be applied seven times
and was easy to miss. They now live in `.github/scripts/lib/set_env_common.sh`,
which every script sources. This keeps it that way: the library defines them,
no script redefines them, and every script sources the library.

Pure text: the scripts cannot be executed here (they provision vendor
environments), but the wiring is fully visible in their source.
