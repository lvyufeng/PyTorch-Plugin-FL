    ``libascendcl.so`` resolves those calls; a later ``dlopen`` cannot

    The capability table is intentionally about observable behavior, not vendor

    Ascend was the last backend held out of the device-side rows, and it was held
    out by a stale observation rather than by a measured gap: its row predates
    the CANN MSPTI tracer and left device/kernel/runtime/flow/metadata False, so
    ten of the twelve cases in tests/integration/test_profiler_contract.py
    skipped and the two that ran could not fail. Measured on Ascend 910 with
    CANN 9.0 and the process-start preload that .github/configs/ascend.yml
    installs, nine of those ten pass; the tenth asserted a runtime ``cbid``
    argument that MSPTI has no field for, and is now its own row below.

    Device-time linkage was the one row that did not open with them: MSPTI
    stamped every launch with the CPU op that started *after* it, so the
    launching operator kept ``self_device_time_total == 0.0``. That turned out
    to be this repository's defect rather than the vendor's -- ``popCorrelation``
    passed a null out-parameter, which CANN rejects without unwinding, leaving
    the external-correlation stack to grow for the life of the process (issue
    #425). With the pop fixed the launching operator owns its device events, so
    the ``linkage`` row below is True on its measured merits and
    ``test_profiler_device_time_linkage`` runs as an ordinary case on the Ascend
    job instead of reporting as an XFAIL.

    Under a FlagGems-first conf (``backends_cuda.conf``) every op the shared
    workload used to reach cuBLAS with -- ``mm``, ``relu``, ``sort``, ``sum``,
    ``randn`` -- is a Triton kernel. That costs the trace three things the
    profiler contract asserts on, all measured on A100:

    * no cuBLAS gemm-workspace zeroing, so no ``gpu_memset`` record at all
      (the category disappears and ``test_profiler_memset_events`` fails);
    * no ``External id`` among the kernel ``args``, so device time cannot be
      attributed to the launching op;
    * no ``::``-qualified kernel name, so the demangling assertion has no
      subject and stops testing anything.

    ``torch.linalg.lu_factor`` puts all three back. ``linalg_lu_factor_ex`` is
    routed ``cuda`` by every conf that implements it, its cuSOLVER getrf zeroes
    a workspace (a ``gpu_memset`` owned by ``aten::linalg_lu_factor_ex``, 512
    bytes at this size) and its kernels are C++ templates whose names carry
    ``::``.

    64x64 is the smallest size measured to still allocate that workspace, and
    costs ~32 KB plus one call -- far below the 1024x1024 ``linalg.solve`` that
    was the first candidate. Sizes 16/32/64/128 were all measured to produce the
    record; the larger ones buy nothing.

    Gated on the memset capability rather than appended unconditionally. The
    probe exists to produce a memset record, so a backend whose contract asserts
    on one is the only place it earns its cost; elsewhere it adds a call the
    platform does not check, and on backends routing ``linalg_lu_factor_ex`` to
    ``none`` (ascend, gcu, musa) it is not on the device path at all.

    The MetaX MCPTI tracer currently segfaults while Kineto processes the

    contract honest by skipping the fixture on that platform until the tracer
    can safely export this workload.

    Shape and iteration count are kept identical to ``_run_traced_ops()`` in
    test_profiler_parity.py, which is the workload proven to emit every activity
    class this module asserts on. It matters for memsets specifically: cuBLAS
    only allocates (and zeroes) a gemm workspace once the matmul is large enough
    and repeated enough to pick a workspace-using kernel. A 256x256 x3 loop stays
    under that threshold on CUDA and produced no gpu_memset events at all, while
    still passing on backends whose sort allocates zeroed scratch -- so shrinking
    this workload silently converts the memset assertion into a no-op on some
    vendors and a failure on others.

    ``append_boxing_path_probe`` closes the other half of that hole: a conf that
    reroutes the matmul away from cuBLAS removes the memset for a reason that has
    nothing to do with workload size. See its docstring.
