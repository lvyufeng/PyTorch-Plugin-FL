# Ascend Installation Guide

Ascend NPU uses native CANN ACLNN operator kernels, not CUDA boxing. The platform supports two operator execution paths: a default pure ACLNN backend and an optional FlagGems route via triton-ascend.

## Prerequisites

- **CPU PyTorch 2.10.x**: `torch==2.10.0` from the upstream CPU index
- **CANN toolkit**: Ascend 910 with CANN 9.0.0 or compatible version
- **Python**: 3.8 or later
- **Operating System**: Linux (aarch64 verified in CI; x86_64 on real hardware)
- **Device node**: `/dev/davinci_manager` and `/dev/davinci*` devices must be accessible

## Installation

### 1. Install CPU PyTorch

```bash
pip install torch==2.10.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

### 2. Source the CANN toolkit environment

```bash
source /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/set_env.sh
```

Verify that `ASCEND_HOME` points to a directory containing `lib64/` and `include/`:

```bash
ls $ASCEND_HOME/lib64/libascendcl.so
ls $ASCEND_HOME/include/aclnn_base.h
```

### 3. Build and install torch_fl

The default configuration enables the FlagGems Python route for measured operators,
with native ACLNN kernels as the fallback:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flagos-ai/PyTorch-Plugin-FL.git
cd PyTorch-Plugin-FL

ACCELERATOR=ascend pip install --no-build-isolation -v -e .
```

Build flags:
- `ACCELERATOR=ascend`: selects the Ascend build path and native ACLNN kernel backend
- `ASCEND_KERNEL=1`: compiled automatically when `ACCELERATOR=ascend` (default ON)
- `CUDA_KERNEL=0`: automatically disabled for Ascend (no CUDA runtime exists)
- `--no-build-isolation`: ensures the build uses your installed CPU torch, not pip's overlay

The build runs `scripts/codegen_ascend.py` to generate operator kernels calling ACLNN APIs (`libopapi.so`) directly. Coverage is category-driven: unary, binary, reductions, and matmul families are generated; ops without an ACLNN mapping fall back to CPU.

## Verification

### Import order

**Critical**: always import `torch_fl` before other packages that might register device backends:

```python
import torch_fl  # Must come first
import torch
```

On an Ascend NPU box (detected via `/dev/davinci*`), `torch_fl` auto-selects `backends_ascend.conf` with no environment variable needed.

### Check device availability

```python
import torch_fl
import torch

print(f"flagos available: {torch_fl.flagos.is_available()}")
print(f"flagos devices: {torch_fl.flagos.device_count()}")

x = torch.randn(64, 64, device="flagos:0")
y = torch.abs(x)
print(f"abs matches CPU: {torch.allclose(y.cpu(), x.cpu().abs())}")
```

Expected output:
```
flagos available: True
flagos devices: 1  (or more, depending on your NPU count)
abs matches CPU: True
```

## Testing

Run the Ascend operator suite:

```bash
pytest tests/integration/ops/ -m "ascend" -v -s --tb=short
```

Run the RNG dispatch suite:

```bash
pytest tests/integration/ops/test_rng_dispatch.py -m "main_ops" -v -s --tb=short
```

Run general factory operator tests:

```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_factory_ops.py -v -s --tb=short
```

All three test groups are exercised in CI (see `.github/configs/ascend.yml` lines 78-97).

## FlagGems via triton-ascend

FlagGems provides Triton-compiled kernels for the measured Ascend routes, with ACLNN remaining the native fallback. Ascend installations and CI enable this path by default; operators that FlagGems does not cover continue through ACLNN or CPU fallback.

### Why FlagGems requires a fork

The upstream FlagGems package links against `libtorch_npu.so` (from the `torch_npu` vendor package), which occupies the same `PrivateUse1` dispatch key as `torch_fl` and cannot coexist. Our fork replaces that dependency with a `FLAGOS` backend that obtains the ACL stream via `torch_fl`'s `GetCurrentStream` C API.

See [`docs/vendors/ascend/external-libtorch-npu.md`](external-libtorch-npu.md) for the technical analysis proving why `torch_npu` cannot act as a compatibility fallback.

### Install FlagGems (torch_fl branch)

The FlagGems package must be installed before building `torch_fl`, so the Python
operator wrappers and runtime discovery are available in the same environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flagos-ai/FlagGems.git
cd FlagGems

source /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/set_env.sh

pip install --no-build-isolation -e . \
  --config-settings=cmake.define.FLAGGEMS_BACKEND=FLAGOS \
  --config-settings=cmake.define.FLAGGEMS_BUILD_C_EXTENSIONS=OFF

cd ..
```

The `FLAGOS` backend skips the C++ extension build (`liboperators.so`) and provides only the Python dispatch path.

### Rebuild torch_fl with FlagGems Python wrappers

```bash
ACCELERATOR=ascend FLAGGEMS_KERNEL=0 FLAGGEMS_PYTHON=1 \
  CUDA_KERNEL=0 ASCEND_KERNEL=1 \
  pip install --no-build-isolation -v -e .
```

Build flags:
- `FLAGGEMS_PYTHON=1`: enables Python-dispatch wrappers for FlagGems Triton kernels
- `FLAGGEMS_KERNEL=0`: disables C++ kernel wrappers (the FLAGOS backend does not build `liboperators.so`)
- `ASCEND_KERNEL=1`: keeps the native ACLNN backend for ops FlagGems cannot compile

### Patch triton-ascend

The stock `triton-ascend` package depends on `torch_npu`. Patch it to use the `flagos` device interface instead:

```bash
python scripts/patch_triton_ascend.py
```

The script is idempotent. After patching, clear stale kernel cache:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.triton/cache/
```

### Runtime libstdc++ compatibility

FlagGems pulls in `sqlalchemy`, which requires `CXXABI_1.3.15`. If your system `libstdc++.so.6` is older, preload conda's:

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libstdc++.so.6
```

### Enable FlagGems at runtime

The generated Ascend configuration is FlagGems-first, so no runtime opt-in is
needed. Importing `torch_fl` initializes the default route; the following command
checks that the installed FlagGems package is available:

```bash
python -c "
import torch_fl, flag_gems, torch
x = torch.randn(64, 64, device='flagos:0')
print('abs matches CPU:', torch.allclose(torch.abs(x).cpu(), x.cpu().abs()))
"
```

There is no separate `*_flagos_py.conf`. An Ascend build is identified by its
`lib/flagos_platform` marker and always loads `backends_ascend.conf`, which is
generated FlagGems-first: every routable op is listed exactly once with its
resolved backend, ops triton-ascend cannot compile sit on `ascend` (the ACLNN
kernel), and ops Ascend does not register at all are written `none` so they reach
`cpu_fallback`. Reading the file tells you the whole routing. `FLAGOS_USE_FLAGGEMS`
remains accepted for compatibility but is not required to activate the default
routes.

To measure the two backends against each other, collapse the table with
`ALL_USE_FLAGGEMS=1` or `ALL_USE_VENDOR=1` (mutually exclusive). Each only moves
an op when the target actually implements it; ops that cannot move are listed on
stderr and stay put, so `ALL_USE_VENDOR` is partial by nature.

## Optional: torch.compile via triton-ascend

`torch.compile(backend="flagos")` compiles inductor's fused Triton kernels with
`triton-ascend`. It needs the same environment as the FlagGems route above — the
patched `triton-ascend` and its `libstdc++` preload — but not `FLAGOS_USE_FLAGGEMS`
and not `FLAGOS_USE_FLAGTREE`; the profile is picked from the `ACCELERATOR=ascend`
build. Eager ACLNN keeps working unchanged if `triton-ascend` is absent.

FlagTree is not the recommended route here, and is not required. Its Ascend
backend exists only on the 3.5-line branches (`triton_v3.5.x` /
`v0.6.0-rc2-triton3.5`; it is absent from `main` and the 3.6/3.7 branches), there
is no `flagtree` wheel on PyPI so it must be built from source, and installing it
*replaces* the `triton` package — taking `triton-ascend` and the FlagGems path
down with it. Use a separate environment if you want to try it.

That backend is also coupled to `torch_npu`, which claims PrivateUse1 and would
leave `torch_fl` unable to register `flagos`. The coupling is at the C++ and link
level, not just a Python import: upstream's `torch_npu` backend policy emits
`-ltorch_npu`, includes `<torch_npu/csrc/core/npu/NPUWorkspaceAllocator.h>`, and
generates `at_npu::native::` calls. A stub `torch_npu` module therefore cannot
work — the launcher would fail to compile.

`torch_fl/compile/flagtree_ascend_policy.py` works around this by registering a
third backend policy, `flagos`, on FlagTree's strategy registry. It answers the
same strategy names from torch_fl's own runtime: device and stream come from
`torch.flagos` and the ACL stream registry, and the generated C++ uses plain ATen
against PrivateUse1 (which under `torch_fl` *is* flagos) instead of `at_npu::`.
It installs automatically when `FLAGOS_USE_FLAGTREE=1` on an Ascend build, and
also forces `TRITON_ENABLE_TASKQUEUE=false`, because the task queue is
torch_npu-only (`at_npu::native::OpCommand`) and defaults to on upstream.

Status: the policy is verified only up to the boundary that can be checked
without a FlagTree build — the emitted C++ compiles against real ATen headers
using just the flags the policy emits, and every strategy FlagTree's driver
dispatches resolves through FlagTree's real registry class with `flagos` owning
PrivateUse1. End-to-end kernel compilation and execution through FlagTree has not
been run, because no FlagTree build carrying the Ascend backend is installed in
this environment. Treat it as unvalidated until that exists.

Upstream request to remove the need for this shim:
https://github.com/flagos-ai/FlagTree/issues/1046

```bash
TORCH_DEVICE_BACKEND_AUTOLOAD=0 python -c "
import torch, torch_fl

def f(x):
    return torch.nn.functional.relu(x + 1.0) * 2.0

x = torch.randn(64, 64, device='flagos:0')
print('compile matches eager:', torch.allclose(torch.compile(f, backend='flagos')(x), f(x)))
"
```

`TORCH_DEVICE_BACKEND_AUTOLOAD=0` matters if `torch_npu` is installed in the same
environment: `import torch` autoloads it, it claims PrivateUse1, and `torch_fl`
then refuses to register `flagos`.

Support is **experimental**. Measured on a real 910 (`Ascend910_9382`, CANN 9.0.0,
triton-ascend 3.2.0, torch 2.10.0+cpu, Python 3.10):
`tests/integration/test_compile.py` passes 30 of 32 with a cold inductor cache,
the two remaining cases being FlagTree-only and MetaX-only. Run it with the cache
cleared —

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/torchinductor_root
TORCH_DEVICE_BACKEND_AUTOLOAD=0 pytest tests/integration/test_compile.py -v
```

— because a warm cache hides the compile-worker crash described below.

Three triton-ascend defects are worked around in
`torch_fl/compile/`, each documented with its measured evidence in
[`docs/architecture/torch-compile-integration.md`](../../architecture/torch-compile-integration.md):
a masked 2-D byte load that silently reads wrong data (this produced incorrect
`relu` gradients), `ub overflow` raised as a hard compile error rather than a
resource limit, and a segfault when the parent process launches a kernel built in
an inductor compile worker. The last one makes Ascend default to
`compile_threads=1`; an explicit `compile_threads` option or
`TORCHINDUCTOR_COMPILE_THREADS` still wins.

## Limitations

### No model mount in CI

`.github/configs/ascend.yml` (line 110) explicitly defers Qwen3 inference/training smoke tests pending a model mount on the CI runner. Point measurements outside CI show training at 0.82x `torch_npu` performance on real Ascend 910 hardware (`tests/perf/e2e_qwen3_train_ascend.py`).

### No device-side profiler parity yet

The Ascend profiler path does not yet emit device-side event categories (kernel, gpu_memcpy, gpu_memset, runtime, ac2g flows). The flagos trace has only `['Trace', 'cpu_op']` versus the torch-cuda baseline. `test_profiler_parity.py` is excluded from CI until device/runtime events are implemented (`.github/configs/ascend.yml` lines 112-117).

### torch.compile is not covered in CI

The Ascend CI runner image does not carry `triton-ascend`, so
`tests/integration/test_compile.py` has no CI step and the compile path is
validated only by hand on hardware that has the toolchain installed. The results
quoted above are point measurements, not a continuously enforced gate.

### Distributed support is architectural only

Distributed collectives route through FlagCX (recommended) or an HCCL fallback. The routing architecture is in place (see [`docs/architecture/distributed-flagcx.md`](../../architecture/distributed-flagcx.md) lines 204-208), but collective-level CI tests on Ascend hardware do not yet exist. The HCCL fallback and the `flagos→npu` zero-copy view are routing logic, not on-hardware-verified collectives (same document, lines 67-75).
