# Ascend NPU environment for the common build/integration workflow.
#
# Ascend is a standalone vendor backend (pure CANN ACLNN). Unlike CUDA it has no
# boxing layer, and unlike MetaX it does not shim a CUDA runtime. The wheel is
# built against a stock CPU PyTorch (2.10.0+cpu); the ACLNN shared libraries
# from the CANN toolkit are linked at runtime via LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
#
# FlagGems runs here on FlagTree, not on triton-ascend. triton-ascend 3.2.x was
# the previous provider and is gone: it lags the Triton APIs current FlagGems
# uses, its task-queue launch path calls at_npu::native::OpCommand (a torch_npu
# symbol torch_fl must not link), and the exact-string patch that used to strip
# those calls stopped matching on 3.2.2 and silently no-opped, which broke 11
# operator tests in run 34786387238. FlagTree's ascend3.5 wheel is the Triton
# 3.5 build for this backend, and torch_fl carries a torch_npu-free backend
# policy for it (torch_fl/compile/flagtree_ascend_policy.py), so no torch_npu
# appears anywhere in this environment. See docs/vendors/ascend/installation.md.

# SIGSEGV exits in add, embedding, le, mean, and mm subprocesses when every
# process inherited it. Keep the prepared value under an inert variable; the

# that test's `environment` mapping. The visible pytest command remains exactly
# the same on every platform, without destabilizing unrelated Ascend tests.
#
# Guarded on the file existing so a CANN image without the profiling tools does
# not get an LD_PRELOAD that ld.so can only warn about. The variable is always
# assigned because the GITHUB_ENV loop reads each name with ${!name} under
