"""Device-independent coverage for the DataParallel/flagos patches.

The patches themselves need a flagos device (see
``tests/manual/test_dataparallel_live.py`` for the on-device run), so this file
pins the two parts that need no hardware:

  * the device-type helpers, which are what decide whether a module is routed to
    the flagos construction path at all -- a wrong answer here is silent, and
    sends a flagos module down the cuda-first path the patch exists to avoid;
  * the wiring: that the ecosystem phase installs all three patches, that the
    comm patch hands torch's comm primitives to the extension, and that the
    extension publishes exactly the primitives torch's comm layer calls -- a
    torch upgrade that reaches for a new one would otherwise escape the patch
    silently;
  * that the scatter scope a flagos ``DataParallel`` sets is restored on the way
    out, including when the scatter raises;
  * that a module which is *not* on a flagos device still reaches the original
    ``__init__``.

Parsed and exec'd rather than imported: ``torch_fl/__init__.py`` imports torch
and loads ``torch_fl._C``, which needs a built wheel and hardware. Same approach
as ``tests/unit/test_import_phase_order.py``, for the same reason.
