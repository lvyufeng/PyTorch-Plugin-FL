    ``libascendcl.so`` resolves those calls; a later ``dlopen`` cannot
    substitute, even when it happens before the first ACL call. CI establishes
    this in ``.github/scripts/set_env_ascend.sh``, alongside the other Ascend
    environment prerequisites, so the profiler contract is invoked with the same
    command on every platform.

    This reads the link map rather than ``LD_PRELOAD`` on purpose: ``ld.so``
    only warns and continues when a preloaded path does not exist, so a mistyped
    ``LD_PRELOAD`` yields the env string without the library, and an env-based
    check would claim a capability the process does not have.

    class this module asserts on. It matters for memsets specifically: cuBLAS

    and repeated enough to pick a workspace-using kernel. A 256x256 x3 loop stays
    under that threshold on CUDA and produced no gpu_memset events at all, while
    still passing on backends whose sort allocates zeroed scratch -- so shrinking
    this workload silently converts the memset assertion into a no-op on some
